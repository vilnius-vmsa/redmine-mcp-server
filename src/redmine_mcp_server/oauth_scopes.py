"""OAuth scope advertisement for the Redmine MCP server.

This module is the single source of truth for the ``scopes_supported``
list returned by ``/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`` and
``/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/mcp``.

Scope identifiers are Redmine Doorkeeper scope names. In stock Redmine
6.x they match the permission name from ``lib/redmine/access_control.rb``.

Maintenance:
    1. When adding a new MCP tool, identify the underlying python-redmine
       endpoint it calls and the Redmine permission gating that endpoint.
    2. Verify the permission name is registered in
       ``lib/redmine/access_control.rb`` (Redmine 6.x source tree).
    3. Add the permission to ``READ_SCOPES`` if the tool is read-only,
       or ``WRITE_SCOPES`` if the tool mutates state.

Exclusions:
    - ``admin`` is never advertised. Tokens with admin scope bypass
      per-permission checks; default-advertising it would mean every
      consent screen requests full administrative access.
    - Vendor plugin scopes (Easy Redmine, RedmineUP, agile, checklists,
      CRM, products) are excluded from ``READ_SCOPES`` and
      ``WRITE_SCOPES``. They vary by deployment; advertising scopes a
      Redmine doesn't recognize causes consent errors. Where a tool
      cannot function without them, they live in a feature-gated list
      (``AGILE_READ_SCOPES``, ``TAGS_READ_SCOPES``,
      ``TAGS_WRITE_SCOPES``, ``CRM_READ_SCOPES``, ``CRM_WRITE_SCOPES``,
      ``DEALS_READ_SCOPES``, ``DEALS_WRITE_SCOPES``,
      ``CRM_NOTES_WRITE_SCOPES``)
      and are advertised only when that feature's env flag is set.

    Resolves to ``GET /users/current.json`` under the hood. Works for any
    authenticated user, not admin-only. Useful when an LLM needs to
    identify "me" — for example, when a user says "log 2h on this issue
    for me", the LLM can call this tool to get the current user's ID.

    With ``include_memberships`` it also answers "which projects am I a
    member of, and with which roles" in that same request. The only other
    way to get that is ``list_project_members`` once per project.

    Each membership is ``{id, project: {id, name}, roles: [{id, name}]}``.
    A role held through a group carries ``inherited: true``; Redmine omits
    the key for a role held directly, and so does this tool -- so test for
    the key, do not expect ``inherited: false``. Redmine limits the list to
    projects visible to the caller, which covers active and closed projects
    but not archived ones: an empty list means none visible, not
    necessarily none held.

    Args:
        include_memberships: Add ``memberships`` to the response. Costs no
            extra request -- the include rides the same call -- so this is
            opt-in only to keep the default response small.

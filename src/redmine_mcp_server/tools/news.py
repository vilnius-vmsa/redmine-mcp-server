"""News tools: read project announcements, and manage them.

Redmine news are project-level announcements -- a title, a one-line summary,
a body, and optionally comments and attachments. Reading has been in the
REST API since Redmine 1.1; writing arrived in 4.1.

Two shapes of this API need care, and both are handled here rather than
passed on to the caller:

- **Writes answer 204 with no body**, create included. python-redmine's
  ``NewsManager`` compensates on create by re-reading
  ``news.filter(**self.params)[0]``. Those params carry the ``project_id``
  that was posted, so the read-back is scoped to the target project rather
  than to the newest news anywhere: the remaining race is someone else
  posting to the *same* project in the same instant. Narrow, but not
  nothing, so the read-back is verified against the title that was sent and
  a create whose result cannot be confirmed says so instead of returning a
  neighbour's record.
- **Two failures arrive as plain HTTP codes** that mean something specific
  here, and both are ambiguous until something is read back.
  ``News.redmine_version`` is ``(1, 1, 0)`` for the whole resource, so
  python-redmine raises no version error where the write endpoint is
  absent: the POST simply 404s, which a caller would read as a missing
  project. Core Redmine has exposed create, update and delete since 4.1,
  but distributions vary, so the message names the endpoint rather than a
  core version. And a 403 is either the project's news module being off --
  Redmine checks the module before any permission, so an administrator is
  refused too -- or an
  ordinary permission denial. The module is read back and only claimed when
  it really is off, because telling an operator to switch on something that
  is already on sends them looking in the wrong place. The codes are
  ``NEWS_WRITE_UNSUPPORTED`` and ``NEWS_MODULE_DISABLED``, and they apply to
  reads as much as writes.

The list endpoint takes ``project_id`` as a query parameter rather than in
the path, because python-redmine's ``News.query_filter`` is ``/news.json``
with no placeholder. Redmine reads it either way, and answers 404 for a
project that does not exist.

    Lists accessible projects in Redmine.

    Returns ONLY active projects unless ``filters`` says otherwise. Redmine's
    ``ProjectQuery`` starts out with a ``status = 1`` filter already set, so a
    call that passes no ``status`` answers with active projects alone while
    looking like the whole list. Pass ``filters={"status": "1|5"}`` to get
    closed projects alongside active ones. ``status`` takes only the ``=``
    and ``!`` operators, so ``"*"`` is not a way to ask for every status --
    it would be read as a literal value and match nothing.

    ``filters`` narrows the collection server-side. A filter Redmine cannot
    read is not an error there -- it answers 200 with the collection
    unnarrowed -- so check the result against what was asked for.

    With ``include_custom_fields`` this is the only tool that returns project
    custom field *values*, which are a different set from the issue custom
    fields ``list_project_issue_custom_fields`` covers. No tool exposes custom
    field *definitions* -- ``field_format``, ``is_required``,
    ``possible_values`` -- for either set: Redmine serves those to
    administrators only.

    Args:
        include_custom_fields: Add ``custom_fields`` to each project. Costs no
            extra request; opt-in only to keep the default response small.
        limit: Maximum number of projects to return, up to 1000. Omitted by
            default, which returns every visible project -- what this tool has
            always done, and the cheapest way to do it. A supplied limit is
            paged in full however few projects exist, so ``limit=1000`` on a
            seven-project instance costs ten requests to return seven rows:
            ask for a number you want, not a large one meaning "all".
        offset: Projects to skip before collecting results. With no
            ``limit`` a late offset costs what reading from zero costs --
            paging runs ``total_count`` rows *from* ``offset`` rather than up
            to it -- so pair a large ``offset`` with a ``limit``.
        include_pagination_info: Return
            ``{"projects": [...], "pagination": {...}}`` rather than a bare
            list (default: False), with the keys ``list_redmine_issues``
            returns. ``total`` is Redmine's own count for the filtered
            collection and costs no extra request -- except where a
            deployment suppresses API metadata (``nometa``), which truncates
            the list at one page and reports a ``total`` that agrees with it.
        filters: Redmine query filters, for what this signature does not
            name -- most usefully ``{"cf_42": "value"}`` for a project custom
            field. Accepted keys are ``status``, ``id``, ``name``,
            ``description``, ``parent_id``, ``is_public``, ``created_on`` and
            ``updated_on``, plus ``cf_<id>`` and its chained spellings; any
            other key is refused, with an error naming what it objected to.
            Each value is one scalar -- a string, number, date or datetime,
            never a list, a dict, ``None`` or a ``bool`` (write a yes/no
            filter as ``"1"``). An operator rides inside the value as a
            prefix, as in ``{"created_on": ">=2024-01-01"}`` or
            ``{"name": "~api"}``, and alternatives join with ``|``, as in
            ``{"status": "1|5"}``; an operator the filter's type does not
            accept is read as a literal value rather than erroring. A
            ``cf_<id>`` must be a *project* custom field, visible to the
            caller, with "Used as a filter" on.

    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries, each representing a project -- or, with
        ``include_pagination_info``, a dict of ``projects`` and
        ``pagination``. Each project carries ``id``, ``name``,
        ``identifier``, ``description``, ``homepage``, ``parent``,
        ``status``, ``is_public``, ``inherit_members``, ``created_on`` and
        ``updated_on``, which is what Redmine's project index renders.
        ``status`` is Redmine's integer code -- ``1`` active, ``5`` closed.
        ``parent`` is ``{id, name}``, or ``null``: Redmine renders it only
        when the parent exists *and* is visible to the caller, so ``null``
        means top-level **or** a parent this caller cannot see, and the two
        cannot be told apart. A key the payload did not carry is ``null``
        rather than a substituted default. With ``include_custom_fields``,
        each project also carries ``custom_fields``, a list of
        ``{id, name, value}`` entries -- empty if the project has none. On
        failure, a dict with an ``error`` key.

) -> Union[List[Dict[str, Any]], Dict[str, Any]]:
    """List the ids and names of the issue custom fields enabled for a project.

    Against a stock Redmine only ``id`` and ``name`` carry data. ``field_format``,
    ``is_required``, ``multiple``, ``default_value``, ``possible_values`` and
    ``trackers`` come back ``null``, meaning "not readable on this token" --
    ``null`` is not ``false`` and not an empty list. In particular
    ``is_required: null`` does not mean a field is optional, so a create or
    update can still reject on a field listed here. Use the ids with
    ``extra_fields={"custom_fields": [{"id": N, "value": ...}]}``, or pass the
    field by name in ``fields``.

    Args:
        project_id: Project identifier (ID number or string identifier).
        tracker_id: Optional tracker ID to filter custom fields by
            applicability. Usable only when the response describes every
            field's tracker bindings, which a stock Redmine does not send; it
            returns an error rather than an unfiltered list when it cannot.

    Returns:
        A list of dicts with ``id``, ``name``, ``field_format``,
        ``is_required``, ``multiple``, ``default_value``,
        ``possible_values`` and ``trackers``. On failure, a dict with an
        ``"error"`` key is returned (callers should check
        ``isinstance(result, dict)`` to distinguish failure from an
        empty list).

    Why the six keys are unreadable: this tool reads
    ``GET /projects/{id}.json?include=issue_custom_fields``, which Redmine
    renders as exactly ``id`` and ``name`` per field
    (``app/helpers/projects_helper.rb``; the same two keys in 6.1, 7.0 and
    trunk).
    The definitions live on ``GET /custom_fields.json``, which Redmine
    restricts to administrators (``before_action :require_admin``), so a
    non-admin token cannot obtain them at all -- and under OAuth even an
    administrator's token cannot, because ``User#admin?`` additionally
    requires the token to carry the ``admin`` scope, which this server
    never requests. Redmine has four open requests to expose this metadata
    to non-admins (redmine.org #18875, #41318, #42581, #43407), none with a
    target version. The keys are kept rather than dropped so the response
    shape is stable and starts carrying data if that ever changes.

    **``is_required`` caveat (#119):** even where the flag *is* readable it
    only reflects the custom field *definition*. Required-ness can also be
    imposed by **workflow rules**, **role-based field permissions**, or
    **tracker-bound required-field settings**, none of which are
    reflected in it. A custom field with ``is_required: false`` can still
    cause ``create_redmine_issue`` / ``update_redmine_issue`` to reject
    with ``"<field name> cannot be blank"``.

    No general-purpose API exists for the "effective" required state.
    Recovery when the create/update call rejects:

    1. **Name-keyed shortcut (preferred):** pass the rejected field by
       name directly, e.g.
       ``fields={"Department": "Engineering"}``, on either
       ``create_redmine_issue`` or ``update_redmine_issue``. Both tools
       resolve the name to a ``custom_fields`` id; ambiguous names
       raise.
    2. **Explicit id form:** pass
       ``extra_fields={"custom_fields": [{"id": N, "value": "..."}]}``
       using the numeric ID from this tool. Works on either path; use
       when the name lookup is ambiguous or the value type is awkward
       (multi-value fields, complex serializations).
    3. **Autofill:** set
       ``REDMINE_AUTOFILL_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELDS=true`` to have the
       server retry once with values from each field's ``default_value``
       or the ``REDMINE_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELD_DEFAULTS`` map. Against a
       stock Redmine only the env map can supply a value, since
       ``default_value`` is not in the payload.

    ``create_redmine_issue`` and ``update_redmine_issue`` augment their
    validation error envelope with ``missing_required_fields`` and a
    matching ``hint`` when this pattern fires, so a caller hitting the
    error gets recovery context inline.

    Use this tool to set up a new project, rename one, change its
    description, homepage, parent, visibility, enabled modules, trackers or
    custom field values, or to close a finished project and reopen it later.
    A closed project stays visible and readable but accepts no edits.

    This tool writes the project record itself. Its contents have their own
    tools: ``manage_redmine_version`` for versions,
    ``manage_project_member`` for memberships, ``manage_issue_category``
    for issue categories.

    Archiving is not offered. Redmine gates ``archive`` and ``unarchive``
    on administrator rights rather than on a project permission, so no
    non-admin token can reach them. Deleting is not offered either: it
    destroys every issue, wiki page and file in the project and in each of
    its subprojects.

    Args:
        action: Operation to perform. One of: ``create``, ``update``,
            ``close``, ``reopen``.
        project_id: Project ID or string identifier. Required for
            ``update``, ``close`` and ``reopen``.
        name: Project name. Required for ``action="create"``.
        identifier: URL identifier, e.g. ``lunar-programme``. Required for
            ``action="create"`` and rejected for ``action="update"``,
            because Redmine freezes it once the project exists.
        description: Project description text.
        homepage: Project homepage URL.
        is_public: Whether the project is visible to non-members. Needs the
            ``select_project_publicity`` permission; without it Redmine
            ignores this field rather than refusing the call.
        parent_id: Numeric ID of the parent project. Creating a subproject
            needs ``add_subprojects`` on the parent.
        inherit_members: Whether the project inherits the parent's members.
        enabled_module_names: Modules to enable, e.g.
            ``["issue_tracking", "wiki"]``. Replaces the current set. Needs
            the ``select_project_modules`` permission; without it Redmine
            ignores this field rather than refusing the call.
        tracker_ids: Numeric tracker IDs to enable. Replaces the current set.
        issue_custom_field_ids: Numeric issue custom field IDs to enable.
            Replaces the current set.
        default_assigned_to_id: Numeric user ID used as the default assignee.
        default_version_id: Numeric version ID used as the default version.
        default_issue_query_id: Numeric saved-query ID used as the default
            issue query. Redmine accepts it but does not render it back, so
            it is absent from this tool's response.
        custom_fields: Custom field values, as Redmine's own list of
            ``{"id": ..., "value": ...}`` entries.

    Returns:
        The full project dictionary, read back from Redmine after the write,

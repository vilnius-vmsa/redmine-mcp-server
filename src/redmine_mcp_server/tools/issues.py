    """List Redmine issues with flexible filtering and pagination support.

    A general-purpose tool for listing issues from Redmine. Supports
    filtering by project, status, assignee, tracker, priority, and any
    other Redmine issue filter. Use this to list all issues in a project,
    find unassigned issues, or apply any combination of filters.

    Args:
        project_id: Filter by project (ID or string identifier).
        status_id: Filter by status. Accepts a numeric status ID, or one
            of the Redmine sentinel strings: ``"open"`` (all open
            statuses, the API default when no filter is given),
            ``"closed"`` (all closed statuses), or ``"*"`` (all
            statuses, including closed). Use ``list_redmine_issue_statuses``
            to discover specific numeric IDs.
        tracker_id: Filter by tracker ID.
        assigned_to_id: Filter by assignee. Accepts a numeric user ID or
            the literal string ``"me"`` (retrieves issues assigned to the
            currently authenticated user — i.e. the owner of the
            configured ``REDMINE_API_KEY``, which may be a shared or robot
            account rather than the human operator). Call
            ``get_mcp_server_info`` first to confirm who ``"me"`` resolves
            to when results are unexpectedly empty. Arbitrary strings are
            rejected at the FastMCP boundary, so an operator form such as
            unassigned goes through ``filters`` instead: see ``filters`` below.
        priority_id: Filter by priority ID.
        fixed_version_id: Filter by target version/milestone ID.
        sort: Sort order (e.g., "updated_on:desc").
        limit: Maximum number of issues to return (default: 25, max: 1000).
            Above 100 the request is paged in chunks of 100, costing one
            request per chunk *asked for* rather than per chunk returned:
            a ten-issue project read at ``limit=1000`` costs ten requests
            to return ten rows. Ask for a number you want, not a large one
            meaning "all".
        offset: Number of issues to skip for pagination (default: 0).
        include_pagination_info: Return structured response with pagination
            metadata (default: False).
        include_custom_fields: Add ``custom_fields`` to each issue
            (default: False). Costs no extra request; opt-in only to keep the
            default response small.
        include_relations: Add ``relations`` to each issue (default: False).
            Costs no extra request -- a whole page of issues is one call.
            ``issue_to_id`` may name an issue the caller cannot read, so do
            not classify or count relation edges by their target from this
            output alone.
        fields: List of field names to include in results (default: all).
            Available: id, subject, description, project, status, priority,
            tracker, author, assigned_to, category, fixed_version, parent,
            start_date, due_date, done_ratio, estimated_hours, spent_hours,
            total_estimated_hours, total_spent_hours, is_private, closed_on,
            created_on, updated_on, custom_fields, relations,
            unmapped_fields. Naming ``custom_fields`` or ``relations`` here has the
            same effect as the matching flag, including asking Redmine for the
            relations include. ``["*"]`` or ``["all"]``, on their own, select
            every field except those two, which need their flag -- naming one
            alongside ``["*"]`` narrows the result to just it.
        filters: Redmine query filters, for what this signature does not name
            -- ``{"cf_42": "value"}`` for a custom field above all -- and for
            forms the named parameters above cannot express. It is merged
            *after* them, so a key here overrides the parameter of the same
            name. An operator rides inside the value as a prefix, and
            alternatives join with ``|``: ``{"tracker_id": "56|57"}`` is either
            tracker, ``{"assigned_to_id": "!*"}`` is unassigned, ``"*"`` is
            assigned to anyone, and ``{"priority_id": "!4"}`` is "not 4". An
            operator the filter's type does not accept is read as a literal
            value rather than erroring. A filter Redmine cannot read is not an
            error either -- it answers 200 with the collection unnarrowed -- so
            check the result against what was asked for. A ``cf_<id>`` must be
            an *issue* custom field, visible to the caller, with "Used as a
            filter" on; without that flag the key is discarded silently and the
            response is a plausible superset.
            Accepted keys are the filters ``IssueQuery`` registers, plus those
            ``cf_<id>`` spellings and ``query_id`` (a saved query's id, from
            ``list_redmine_queries``); any other key is refused, naming what it
            objected to. Each value is one scalar -- a string, number, date or
            datetime, never a list, a dict, ``None`` or a ``bool`` (write a
            yes/no filter as ``"1"``); ``include`` is the exception, taking a
            list. ``limit`` and ``offset`` may be passed here too -- some
            clients wrap every parameter into ``filters`` -- and are moved onto
            the named parameters so their bounds apply, rather than overriding
            them.

    Returns:
        List[Dict] (default) or Dict with 'issues' and 'pagination' keys.
        Issues are limited to prevent token overflow (25,000 token MCP limit).

    Examples:
        >>> await list_redmine_issues(project_id=1)
        [{"id": 1, "subject": "Issue 1", ...}, ...]

        >>> await list_redmine_issues(project_id="my-project", status_id=1)
        [{"id": 2, "subject": "Open issue", ...}, ...]

        >>> await list_redmine_issues(
        ...     project_id=1, limit=25, offset=50, include_pagination_info=True
        ... )
        {
            "issues": [...],
            "pagination": {"total": 150, "has_next": True, "next_offset": 75, ...}
        }

        >>> await list_redmine_issues(
        ...     project_id=1, fields=["id", "subject", "status"]
        ... )
        [{"id": 1, "subject": "Bug fix", "status": {...}}, ...]

        >>> await list_redmine_issues(
        ...     project_id=1,
        ...     fields=["id", "custom_fields", "relations"],
        ...     include_relations=True,
        ... )
        [{"id": 1, "custom_fields": [...], "relations": [...]}, ...]

    Performance:
        - Memory efficient: Uses server-side pagination
        - Token efficient: Default limit keeps response under 2000 tokens
        - Further reduce tokens: Use fields parameter for minimal data transfer
        - Time efficient: Typically <500ms for limit=25

    """Search Redmine issues matching a query string with pagination support.

    Performs text search across issues using the Redmine Search API
    (/search.json), then transparently hydrates the matching ids via
    /issues.json so structured fields (subject, status, priority, project,
    assigned_to, author, timestamps) are populated in the response. The
    follow-up fetch is skipped when ``fields`` only requests id and/or
    description, which /search.json can serve on its own.

    Supports server-side pagination to prevent MCP token overflow.

    Args:
        query: Text to search for in issues.
        limit: Maximum number of issues to return (default: 25, max: 1000).
        offset: Number of issues to skip for pagination (default: 0).
        include_pagination_info: Return structured response with pagination
            metadata (default: False).
        fields: List of field names to include in results (default: all).
            Available: id, subject, description, project, status, priority,
            tracker, author, assigned_to, created_on, updated_on,
            custom_fields. Naming ``custom_fields`` hydrates the results
            through the issues endpoint, which renders the values. There is
            no ``relations``: this tool never asks for that include, so the
            key could only ever come back empty.
        scope: Search scope. Values: "all", "my_project", "subprojects".
        open_issues: Search only open issues (default: False).
        options: Additional Redmine Search API parameters as a dict.

    Returns:
        List[Dict] (default) or Dict with 'issues' and 'pagination' keys.
        Issues are limited to prevent token overflow (25,000 token MCP limit).

    Examples:
        >>> await search_redmine_issues("bug fix")
        [{"id": 1, "subject": "Bug in login", ...}, ...]

        >>> await search_redmine_issues(
        ...     "performance", limit=10, offset=0, include_pagination_info=True
        ... )
        {
            "issues": [...],
            "pagination": {"total": None, "limit": 10, "has_next": True, ...}
        }

        >>> await search_redmine_issues("urgent", fields=["id", "subject", "status"])
        [{"id": 1, "subject": "Critical bug", "status": {...}}, ...]

        >>> await search_redmine_issues("bug", scope="my_project", open_issues=True)
        [{"id": 1, "subject": "Open bug in my project", ...}, ...]

    Note:
        The Redmine Search API does not provide total_count, so the
        pagination metadata reports ``total: null`` ("not reported") and
        ``has_next`` falls back to the full-page inference: true whenever
        the page came back full, which is only ever optimistic and costs
        one wasted request at worst.

        Search API Limitations: The Search API supports text search with
        scope and open_issues filters only. For advanced filtering by
        project_id, status_id, priority_id, etc., use list_redmine_issues()
        instead, which uses the Issues API with full filter support.

    Performance:
        - Memory efficient: Uses server-side pagination
        - Token efficient: Default limit keeps response under 2000 tokens
        - Further reduce tokens: Use fields parameter for minimal data transfer

    existing issue see ``copy_issue``; for editing an existing issue
    see ``update_redmine_issue``.

    Compatibility notes:
    - Supports serialized ``fields`` payload (JSON object string)
    - Supports optional ``extra_fields`` payload as object/JSON string
    - Retries once with auto-filled required custom fields if Redmine reports
      relevant validation errors on required custom fields (e.g. blank/invalid)
      and
      ``REDMINE_AUTOFILL_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELDS=true``.
    - When ``REDMINE_TAGS_ENABLED=true``, a ``tag_list`` key in ``fields``
      (list of names or comma-separated string) sets AlphaNodes
      additional_tags tags on the new issue. Requires the
      ``create_issue_tags``/``edit_issue_tags`` permission; silently ignored
      when the feature is disabled (default).

    Args:
        project_id: Project the issue belongs to (numeric ID).
        subject: The issue's title.
        description: The issue's description. Optional.
        fields: Standard and custom fields, as an object or a JSON object
            string. Attachments do not go here -- see ``uploads``.
        extra_fields: Further fields, merged into ``fields``. Object or JSON
            object string.
        uploads: Files to attach to the new issue. Maximum 10 items, 50 MiB
            each. Every item carries exactly one content source:

            - ``upload_id``: a file already staged with
              ``create_upload_ticket``. **The way to send a file that lives
              on the caller's own machine.** The caller POSTs the bytes to
              the ticket's ``upload_url`` in one request, so they travel
              from disk to this server directly and are never written into
              a tool argument.
            - ``source_url``: an HTTP(S) URL this server downloads from.
              Preferred whenever the file is already reachable at one,
              since it spares the caller the bytes entirely.
            - ``content_base64``: the file's bytes, base64-encoded. For
              content the caller **generated** and that is small -- a short
              CSV, an SVG, a note. Not for a file on disk: there is no way
              to pipe a file into a tool argument, so this payload is
              written out character by character by the model, and a long
              one does not reliably survive that. Pass ``sha256`` with it.
            - ``file_path``: a path read on **this server's own**
              filesystem, inside ``ATTACHMENTS_DIR`` or a directory listed
              in ``REDMINE_MCP_UPLOAD_FILE_ROOTS``. It reaches the caller's
              own files only where the server runs on the caller's machine;
              against a server on a different host a caller-side path
              cannot be read, whatever the roots are set to.
            - ``filename``: the name the attachment gets. Required with
              ``content_base64``; derived from the URL or
              ``Content-Disposition`` for ``source_url``, from the basename
              for ``file_path``, and from the ticket for ``upload_id``.
            - ``sha256`` and ``size_bytes``: optional integrity claims,
              checked after the content is resolved and before anything
              reaches Redmine. Worth passing with ``content_base64``, where
              a mangled payload would otherwise be attached silently.
            - ``content_type`` and ``description``: optional, per item.

) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Update an existing Redmine issue.

    In addition to standard Redmine fields, a ``status_name`` key may be
    provided in ``fields``. When present and ``status_id`` is not supplied, the
    function will look up the corresponding status ID and use it for the update.

    When ``REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED=true``, RedmineUP Agile fields may also be set:
    ``story_points``, ``agile_sprint_id`` (set to ``0``/null to remove the issue
    from its sprint), and ``position`` (also accepted as ``agile_position``). Each
    may be given top-level in ``fields`` or nested under an ``agile_data_attributes``
    dict. They are routed to the Agile plugin endpoint separately rather than
    through the standard Redmine update; untouched agile fields are preserved (the
    update happens in place, so setting only the sprint does not clear
    ``story_points``/``position``). The returned issue is augmented with the
    resulting ``story_points``, ``agile_sprint_id``, and ``agile_position`` so the
    change can be verified from the response. When ``REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED=false``
    (default), these agile keys are silently ignored.

    When ``REDMINE_TAGS_ENABLED=true``, a ``tag_list`` key may be provided in
    ``fields`` to set the issue's AlphaNodes additional_tags tags. Accepts a
    list of tag names or a comma-separated string; ``[]`` clears all tags. It
    is handled before custom-field resolution so it is never mistaken for a
    same-named custom field, and requires the ``create_issue_tags`` (new tags)
    or ``edit_issue_tags`` (existing tags only) permission. When
    ``REDMINE_TAGS_ENABLED=false`` (default), ``tag_list`` is silently ignored.

    Non-standard keys in ``fields`` are treated as candidate custom-field names.
    When a matching project custom field is found, it is translated into
    ``custom_fields`` entries for Redmine update payloads.

    Args:
        issue_id: The issue to update.
        fields: The fields to change, including ``notes`` for a comment.
            Attachments do not go here -- see ``uploads``.
        uploads: Files to attach to the issue. Maximum 10 items, 50 MiB
            each. Every item carries exactly one content source:

            - ``upload_id``: a file already staged with
              ``create_upload_ticket``. **The way to send a file that lives
              on the caller's own machine.** The caller POSTs the bytes to
              the ticket's ``upload_url`` in one request, so they travel
              from disk to this server directly and are never written into
              a tool argument.
            - ``source_url``: an HTTP(S) URL this server downloads from.
              Preferred whenever the file is already reachable at one,
              since it spares the caller the bytes entirely.
            - ``content_base64``: the file's bytes, base64-encoded. For
              content the caller **generated** and that is small -- a short
              CSV, an SVG, a note. Not for a file on disk: there is no way
              to pipe a file into a tool argument, so this payload is
              written out character by character by the model, and a long
              one does not reliably survive that. Pass ``sha256`` with it.
            - ``file_path``: a path read on **this server's own**
              filesystem, inside ``ATTACHMENTS_DIR`` or a directory listed
              in ``REDMINE_MCP_UPLOAD_FILE_ROOTS``. It reaches the caller's
              own files only where the server runs on the caller's machine;
              against a server on a different host a caller-side path
              cannot be read, whatever the roots are set to.
            - ``filename``: the name the attachment gets. Required with
              ``content_base64``; derived from the URL or
              ``Content-Disposition`` for ``source_url``, from the basename
              for ``file_path``, and from the ticket for ``upload_id``.
            - ``sha256`` and ``size_bytes``: optional integrity claims,
              checked after the content is resolved and before anything
              reaches Redmine. Worth passing with ``content_base64``, where
              a mangled payload would otherwise be attached silently.
            - ``content_type`` and ``description``: optional, per item.

            An attachment referenced from the description or a note as
            ``attachment:"name.png"`` is rendered inline by Redmine.

    Issue deletion in Redmine is **irreversible** and cascades to the
    issue's children (subtasks), journals (comments), attachments,
    time entries, and inbound relations from issues that referenced
    it. To prevent accidental destruction, this tool refuses unless
    the caller passes ``confirm_delete=True``; the refusal envelope
    includes a structured ``impact`` preview (counts of cascaded
    items) so a caller can decide whether to proceed.

    If the issue has subtasks, ``confirm_delete=True`` alone is not
    enough -- the tool also requires ``confirm_delete_with_children=True``
    so the cascade-delete of subtasks is opt-in twice. This is the
    case most likely to surprise a caller.

    For other lifecycle operations on an issue, use:

    - ``create_redmine_issue`` to create
    - ``update_redmine_issue`` to edit fields (including status,
      priority, custom fields)
    - ``copy_issue`` to duplicate
    - ``get_redmine_issue`` to read

    Args:
        issue_id: ID of the issue to delete. Must be a positive

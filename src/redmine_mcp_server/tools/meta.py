"""Meta / introspection tools.

A single ``get_mcp_server_info`` tool that returns the deployed
package version plus a few non-sensitive runtime flags an MCP client
needs in order to detect deployment lag and choose the right call
shape. Surfaced as a tool (not just an HTTP endpoint) so an LLM caller
can check it through the same protocol it already speaks.

What this deliberately does NOT expose:

- ``REDMINE_URL`` / ``REDMINE_API_KEY`` / OAuth secrets -- credentials
  and internal hostnames stay behind the operator-facing config path.
- File system paths (``ATTACHMENTS_DIR``) -- not interesting to a
  caller and faintly leaky.
- The configured ``PUBLIC_HOST`` / ``REDMINE_PUBLIC_URL`` -- these
  could disclose internal routing detail to a caller that doesn't
  need it.

Only the flags that change *call shape* for the caller are exposed:
which auth mode the server is in, which plugin-gated tool families
are enabled, and whether the server is in read-only mode. The version
string and current-user identity are unambiguously safe.

    Resolves who ``assigned_to_id="me"`` maps to — crucial when a shared

    Uses ``GET /users/current.json`` via async httpx — works on Redmine 3.x

    Redmine instances.

    difference. The endpoint is not admin-gated -- see the

    """Return the MCP server's version, enabled-feature flags, and current user.

    Use this tool to:

    - Detect deployment lag: compare ``server_version`` against the
      release you expect before relying on a recently-shipped fix.
    - Understand who ``"me"`` resolves to: ``current_user`` shows the
      identity behind the configured API key. When a shared or robot API
      key is in use, ``assigned_to_id="me"`` will match **that** account,
      not the human operator — call this tool first if issue queries
      assigned to "me" return unexpectedly empty results.
    - Check which plugin-gated tool families are active.

    Returns:
        A dict with:

        - ``server_version`` (str): the deployed package version (from
          ``importlib.metadata``). The literal ``"0.0.0+unknown"`` when
          the package metadata is unavailable (rare; source-tree runs
          without an editable install).
        - ``read_only_mode`` (bool): whether ``REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY``
          is enabled. When ``True``, all write tools refuse with the
          standard read-only error.
        - ``auth_mode`` (str): ``"oauth"`` or ``"legacy"``.
        - ``current_user`` (dict | None): ``{id, login, name}`` for the
          authenticated Redmine user. ``None`` if the server cannot reach
          Redmine (check ``/health`` for connectivity status).
        - ``plugin_flags`` (dict[str, bool]): which plugin-gated tool
          families are enabled. Always ``agile``, ``checklists``,
          ``products``, ``crm``, ``deals``, ``dmsf``, ``tags``, in that
          order, and after them one key per family this deployment added
          through ``REDMINE_MCP_EXTENSIONS``, named after the family. The
          seven are reserved, so each always carries its own flag.
          ``True`` means the family's tools are listed and routable;
          ``False`` means they are hidden from ``tools/list`` (``agile``
          and ``tags`` only add fields to core tools and are never
          hidden).

    The response intentionally excludes credentials, internal
    hostnames, file-system paths, and any other operator-config that
    a caller doesn't need to know to choose its call shape.

        >>> await get_mcp_server_info()

    ``limit`` and ``offset`` are the window Redmine reports having applied,
    falling back to the requested values when it reports none. Redmine echoes
    both alongside ``total_count``, and a build that served a smaller page than
    was asked for would otherwise get a ``next_offset`` that steps over the
    rows it withheld.

    ``total`` is Redmine's own ``total_count``, which arrives beside the
    collection and so costs no second request -- except under ``search``,
    where it does not measure the collection being paged.
    ``ContactsController#index`` counts with ``@query.object_count``, which is
    ``objects_scope`` with no options, while the rows come from
    ``results_scope(:search => params[:search])``, and ``ContactQuery``
    registers no ``search`` filter (confirmed on 4.4.5 Pro). So the reported
    total is the collection *before* the search. Believing it walks the caller
    through empty pages: a search matching 3 of 250 contacts answers
    ``has_next`` true at offset 0 and again at offset 100, three requests to
    read three rows, where the full-page inference would have said "done"
    correctly. A searched page therefore reports no total, exactly as a build
    that renders none does. Every other narrowing parameter this tool sends is
    a registered ``ContactQuery`` filter, so those narrow the count too and
    the total stays honest.

    """RedmineUP CRM (Contacts) plugin tool. Combined CRUD-by-action.

    Actions: ``list``, ``get``, ``create``, ``update``, ``delete``,
    ``assign_to_project``, ``remove_from_project``.

    Requires ``REDMINE_CRM_ENABLED=true`` and the RedmineUP CRM plugin.

    One flat signature serves every action, so most parameters apply to some
    actions and are ignored by the rest.

    ``search``, ``tags`` and ``assigned_to_id`` narrow a ``list`` on every CRM
    build. The contact attributes narrow one only on the plugin's Pro build,
    which registers them as query filters; the Light build registers ``tags``
    and nothing else, and Redmine drops an unregistered filter parameter
    silently, answering with the unfiltered collection. They are therefore
    refused unless ``REDMINE_CRM_EDITION=pro`` says the Pro build is installed
    -- an explicit error rather than a quietly wrong list.

    Which parameter belongs to which action:

    Args:
        action: Which operation to run. One of ``list``, ``get``, ``create``,
            ``update``, ``delete``, ``assign_to_project``,
            ``remove_from_project``.
        contact_id: The contact to act on. Required by every action except
            ``list`` and ``create``.
        project_id: On ``list``, restrict to contacts in this project. On
            ``create``, the project to file the new contact under (required).
            On ``assign_to_project`` / ``remove_from_project``, the project to
            attach or detach.
        search: ``list`` only. Free-text search over name, company and email.
            Note that Redmine applies it to the page it returns without
            narrowing the reported total, so paging through a search is
            unreliable for more than one page.
        tags: ``list`` only. Comma-separated tag filter.
        assigned_to_id: ``list`` only. Filter by the assigned user's ID.
        author_id: ``list`` only. Filter by the ID of the user who created the
            contact. Needs ``REDMINE_CRM_EDITION=pro``.
        limit: ``list`` only. Contacts per call, capped at 100 by Redmine.
        offset: ``list`` only. Contacts to skip, for paging past the first 100.
        include_pagination_info: ``list`` only. Return
            ``{"contacts": [...], "pagination": {...}}`` rather than a bare
            list (default: False), with the keys ``list_redmine_issues``
            returns. ``total`` is ``null`` whenever Redmine reported no total
            that measures the collection being paged -- read it as "not
            reported", never as a number, and note that passing ``search`` is
            one such case. ``has_next`` is always a boolean, never ``null``,
            so it is safe to loop on.
        include: ``get`` only. Comma-separated related data to request.
        first_name: Required on ``create``. Filters a ``list`` where
            ``REDMINE_CRM_EDITION=pro``.
        last_name: ``create`` attribute. Filters a ``list`` where
            ``REDMINE_CRM_EDITION=pro``.
        middle_name: ``create`` attribute. Filters a ``list`` where
            ``REDMINE_CRM_EDITION=pro``.
        company: ``create`` attribute. Filters a ``list`` where
            ``REDMINE_CRM_EDITION=pro``.
        job_title: ``create`` attribute. Filters a ``list`` where
            ``REDMINE_CRM_EDITION=pro``.
        email: ``create`` attribute. Filters a ``list`` where
            ``REDMINE_CRM_EDITION=pro``.
        phone: ``create`` attribute. Filters a ``list`` where
            ``REDMINE_CRM_EDITION=pro``.
        is_company: ``create`` only -- ``true`` files the record as a company
            rather than a person. This is **not** a list filter: the plugin's
            own ``is_company`` filter returns the same wrong set for every
            value, so filter the ``is_company`` key on the returned contacts
            instead.
        visibility: ``create`` only. ``0`` project, ``1`` public, ``2``
            private.
        fields: ``create`` and ``update`` only. Contact attributes to write.
        filters: ``list`` only. Additional Redmine query parameters, for
            filters this signature does not name -- most usefully
            ``{"cf_42": "value"}`` to filter on a contact custom field. What a
            build registers as a filter is the build's own business, so this
            cannot promise any key works: confirm a narrow filter actually
            narrowed. A contact custom field needs its "Used as a filter"
            setting on, and on the Light edition no contact custom field is
            ever a registered filter. Accepted keys are the filters
            ``ContactQuery`` registers, plus ``cf_<id>``, ``author.cf_<id>``
            and ``assigned_to.cf_<id>``; any other key is refused, with an
            error naming what it objected to. Keys this signature already names
            are rejected too -- pass them as the named parameter so they are
            validated -- as are ``fields``, ``f`` and ``query_id``, which
            Redmine reads as the query's own definition and which discard every
            filter built from the rest of the request. Each value is one scalar
            -- a string, number, date or datetime, never a list, a dict,
            ``None`` or a ``bool`` (write a yes/no filter as ``"1"``).

    Returns:
        ``list`` a list of contact dicts -- or, with
        ``include_pagination_info=True``, a dict of ``contacts`` and
        ``pagination`` -- ``get`` / ``create`` one contact dict, the remaining
        actions a status dict, and ``{"error": ...}`` on failure.

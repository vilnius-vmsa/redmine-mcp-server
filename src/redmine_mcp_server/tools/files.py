    Use this whenever the file to attach lives on the caller's side. It is the

    there is no way to pipe a file into a tool argument, so a
    ``content_base64`` payload is written out character by character by the
    model, and a payload of a few thousand characters does not reliably
    survive that (#305).

    Three steps:

    1. Call this. It answers with ``upload_url``, ``ticket`` and
       ``expires_at``.
    2. Send the file to ``upload_url`` in one HTTP request, with the ticket in
       the ``X-Upload-Ticket`` header and the file as the body::

           curl -sS -H "X-Upload-Ticket: TICKET" --data-binary @file.png URL

       The response carries ``upload_id``, ``size`` and ``sha256``.
       Multipart is deliberately not accepted: the whole body would be
       buffered before its size could be checked.
    3. Name that ``upload_id`` as the content source: in ``uploads`` on
       ``create_redmine_issue`` / ``update_redmine_issue`` /
       ``manage_redmine_wiki_page``, or on ``upload_file``.

    The ticket is good for one upload, for a few minutes
    (``REDMINE_MCP_UPLOAD_TICKET_MINUTES``, default 15), up to
    ``max_bytes``. It authorises nothing else. The staged file is swept on
    the same expiry as a downloaded attachment, so a failed attach can be
    retried without sending the file again.

    Returns:

    This is the project's document store, not an attachment on something.
    To attach a file to an issue, pass ``uploads`` to
    ``create_redmine_issue`` or ``update_redmine_issue``; to a wiki page,
    to ``manage_redmine_wiki_page``. All three take the same content
    sources as this tool.

    **Content sources — provide exactly ONE of:**

    - ``upload_id``: a file already staged with ``create_upload_ticket``.
      **The way to send a file that lives on the caller's own machine.**
      The caller POSTs the bytes to the ticket's ``upload_url`` in one
      HTTP request, so they travel from disk to this server directly and
      are never written into a tool argument.
    - ``source_url``: an HTTP(S) URL the server will download from.
      Preferred whenever the file is already reachable at one — chaining
      from another MCP tool that returns a download URL, a file on the
      public web — since it spares the caller the bytes entirely.
    - ``content_base64``: raw file bytes encoded as base64. For content
      the caller **generated** and that is small: a short CSV, an SVG, a
      note. Not for a file on disk. There is no way to pipe a file into
      a tool argument, so this payload is written out character by
      character by the model, and a long one does not reliably survive
      that (#305). Pass ``sha256`` with it.
    - ``file_path``: a path read on **this server's own** filesystem,
      inside ``ATTACHMENTS_DIR`` or a directory listed in
      ``REDMINE_MCP_UPLOAD_FILE_ROOTS``. It reaches the caller's own
      files only where the server runs on the caller's machine; against
      a server on a different host a caller-side path cannot be read,
      whatever the roots are set to.

    **Integrity:** ``sha256`` and ``size_bytes`` are optional on any
    source and are checked after the content is resolved, before
    anything is sent to Redmine. They matter most for
    ``content_base64``: 64 characters of checksum survive being copied
    in a way a multi-kilobyte payload does not, so a mangled upload
    fails loudly instead of attaching a corrupt file. Take them from the
    same shell invocation that encoded the file.

    Under the hood this performs Redmine's standard two-step upload:
    ``POST /uploads.json`` to get a token, then
    ``POST /projects/{id}/files.json`` to attach it to the project.

    Args:
        project_id: Project identifier (numeric ID or string identifier).
        filename: Name the file should have in Redmine (e.g., ``spec.pdf``).
            Required when using ``content_base64``. Optional with
            ``source_url`` — if omitted, inferred from the URL path.
            Always prefer passing an explicit filename.
        upload_id: A file staged with ``create_upload_ticket``. Mutually
            exclusive with the other three sources.
        content_base64: File content encoded as a base64 string. Mutually
            exclusive with the other three sources.
        source_url: HTTP(S) URL to download the file from. Mutually
            exclusive with the other three sources.
        file_path: Path to a file on this server, inside ``ATTACHMENTS_DIR``
            or a directory listed in ``REDMINE_MCP_UPLOAD_FILE_ROOTS``.
            Mutually exclusive with the other three sources.
        sha256: Optional hex digest of the file. Verified after the content
            is resolved; a mismatch refuses the upload.
        size_bytes: Optional byte count of the file, verified the same way.
        description: Optional human-readable description.
        version_id: Optional version/release ID to attach the file to
            (use ``list_redmine_versions`` to discover valid IDs).

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing the uploaded file's metadata. On failure, a
        dict with an ``"error"`` key is returned.

    Size limit:
        Uploads are capped at 50 MiB. For larger files, upload via the
        Redmine web UI.

    Examples:
        >>> # From a URL (chained from another MCP tool)

    """Delete a file from a Redmine project.

    **Important:** Redmine's ``DELETE /attachments/{id}.json`` endpoint
    removes ANY attachment by ID, not just project files. If ``file_id``
    refers to an issue/wiki attachment (e.g., from
    ``get_redmine_issue(include_attachments=True)``), that attachment
    will be deleted from its issue.

    To avoid accidentally removing issue attachments when you meant to
    remove a project file, the tool verifies the target attachment is
    project-scoped (its ``container_type`` is ``Project``) before
    deleting. Pass ``confirm_delete_any_attachment=True`` to bypass this
    check when you explicitly want to delete an issue/wiki attachment.

    Args:
        file_id: ID of the attachment to delete (the ``id`` field returned
            by ``list_files`` or attachment-include responses).
        confirm_delete_any_attachment: When ``True``, skip the
            project-scope check and delete the attachment regardless of
            container type. Use only when you intentionally want to
            remove an issue/wiki/news attachment via this tool.

    Returns:
        Dictionary with ``success: true`` on success. On failure, a dict
        with an ``"error"`` key is returned.

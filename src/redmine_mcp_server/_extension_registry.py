"""The registered-extension list, kept out of the server import cycle.

:func:`oauth_scopes.advertised_scopes` has to read the registry, and it runs
while ``server.py`` is still executing its own module body: building the auth
provider is what fills ``scopes_supported``, and that happens before ``mcp``
is bound. So the registry cannot live in :mod:`.extensions`, which imports
``.server`` for the ``mcp`` an extension decorates its tools with -- that
import would be a cycle, and it would fail every OAuth-mode startup rather
than only the deployments that set ``REDMINE_MCP_EXTENSIONS``.

This module therefore imports nothing but :mod:`._env`. ``main.py`` and
``tools/meta.py`` read the registry from here. Neither name is part of the
surface an extension depends on, so an extension has no reason to import
this module.

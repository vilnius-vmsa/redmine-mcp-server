"""``api-key-login``: this server as its own OAuth authorization server.

The three older modes all fail on a Redmine without Doorkeeper. ``legacy``
shares one API key, so everyone is the same Redmine user. ``legacy-per-user``
needs an ``X-Redmine-API-Key`` header per request, which a centrally
distributed client cannot supply per user. ``oauth`` and ``oauth-proxy`` need
Doorkeeper's endpoints, which Easy Redmine does not mount and no Redmine below
6.1 has.

Here the server issues its own tokens. The browser step is a page this server
serves (see ``_api_key_login_routes``); the user pastes their personal Redmine
API key, the server validates it with one ``GET /users/current.json``, and
binds it to the tokens it mints. Every tool call then runs as that user, under
that user's Redmine permissions.

Store layout, one collection per record kind::

    clients          client_id          the DCR registration
    transactions     random id          a pending /authorize, TTL 5 min
    codes            random code        AuthorizationCode + binding_id
    bindings         random id          the API key and who it belongs to
                                        (ciphertext under ``token-derived``)
    access_tokens    sha256(token)      {binding_id, scopes, expires_at}
    refresh_tokens   sha256(token)      {binding_id, scopes, expires_at}
    rotated_refresh  sha256(old token)  tombstone for reuse detection

Every record is keyed by ``sha256`` of the capability it belongs to -- token,
transaction id or authorization code -- so a directory listing yields nothing
usable to a reader who has the volume but not the secret.

Every write passes the record's remaining lifetime as the store TTL, so an
expired record is never served. ``FileTreeStore`` does not delete it, though;
the cleanup task does (``_cleanup.sweep_expired_auth_state``, the same sweep
``oauth-proxy`` gets).

Two properties are load-bearing and easy to break:

* **Revocation never enumerates.** Access and refresh tokens hold a
  ``binding_id`` and dereference it on load. Deleting the binding invalidates
  every token pointing at it, which matters because the store contract is
  ``get``/``put``/``delete``/``ttl`` only -- ``keys()`` is optional and not
  guaranteed through the encryption wrapper.
* **Single use rides on ``delete()``.** The store has no compare-and-swap, so
  a transaction, a code, or a rotated refresh token is claimed by deleting it
  and proceeding only when ``delete()`` returns ``True``. That delete is not
  atomic either, so every one of them goes through ``_forget``, which holds a
  per-loop lock and tolerates a peer that got there first. The one counter
  that cannot work this way, ``attempts``, is documented as approximate.
* **A binding is only ever read with its capability in hand.** Under
  ``REDMINE_API_KEY_LOGIN_BINDING_CRYPTO=token-derived`` that is not a style
  rule but the guarantee itself: the key that opens a binding is reachable
  only through a presented code or token. Any new code path that wants to read
  a binding from the side -- an admin view, a sweep, a migration -- cannot work
  under that scheme and must not be built on the assumption that it can.

    Textbook KEK/DEK. ``seal`` draws a random data key, encrypts the payload

    a second time for each capability that may later need it -- the
    authorization code, then every access and refresh token minted from it --
    each time under a key derived from that capability's own value. The store
    therefore holds the *hash* of each token next to a data key encrypted under
    the *token*, and the token itself only ever exists in the client's hands
    and on the wire.

    What that buys, against ``server-secret``: a stolen volume plus the
    operator secret yields ciphertext. Reading a binding needs a live token
    presented to a running server, so the attacker gets the keys of whoever
    transacts while they are watching, not every key of every user who logged
    in during the past month.

    What it costs, permanently:

    * No server-side read of a binding without a token. That rules out a
      session admin UI, background revalidation of stored keys, and
      re-encryption when the signing key rotates. The revalidation at refresh
      is deliberately built the other way round -- it runs with the refresh
      token in hand -- so it keeps working here.
    * A binding whose tokens are all gone is unreadable. Nothing reads it
      again, and its TTL removes it, but it is dead weight until then.
    * Bespoke code where ``server-secret`` leans on the framework's Fernet
      wrapper. That wrapper still runs on top of this, so what reaches disk is
      encrypted twice; verified harmless, since it round-trips a ciphertext
      payload like any other value.

    Every failure to open something returns ``None`` rather than raising: the
    callers already treat an unreadable binding as a session that ends, which
    is the safe direction. The log lines say what could not be opened and
    never the secret that failed to open it.

    ``_handle_redmine_error`` turns into an ``AUTH_FAILED`` envelope.

    This cannot live in that handler: it is synchronous and runs inside the
    ``asyncio.to_thread`` worker the tools offload to, while ``revoke_binding``
    is a coroutine on an async store. anyio's from-thread bridge refuses inside
    an asyncio worker, and ``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` would put a blocking
    cross-thread wait in an error path. Here the work is already on the event
    loop, after ``call_next`` has produced the result.

    The result is returned untouched; the client gets its error and re-runs the
    OAuth flow on the next call. Only 401 reaches this: 403 is a
    ``ForbiddenError`` and stays an ordinary permission error.

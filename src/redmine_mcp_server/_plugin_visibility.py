"""Show plugin-gated tools on the MCP surface only when their plugin is on.

Every plugin tool registers with ``tags={plugin_tag(family)}``. At startup
``main.py`` calls :func:`apply_plugin_visibility`, which turns each family
on or off with FastMCP's visibility transforms. Disabled tools vanish from
``tools/list`` and ``call_tool`` rejects them, so a vanilla Redmine no
longer advertises tools that can only answer "feature disabled".

The call-time guards inside each tool stay: they protect direct Python
callers and the unit tests, which invoke the function objects directly.

Transforms are re-entrant (the later ``enable``/``disable`` wins), which is
what lets tests flip a flag and re-apply without reloading modules.

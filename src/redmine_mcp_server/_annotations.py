"""MCP ToolAnnotations classification for every registered tool (#204).

This module is the single source of truth for the behavior hints returned
in ``tools/list``. It deliberately mirrors the shape of ``oauth_scopes.py``:
one central per-tool table plus an anti-drift test.

Annotations are advisory client metadata. Per the MCP specification they are
hints only, and "clients MUST consider tool annotations to be untrusted
unless they come from trusted servers". Authorization is still enforced by
the OAuth scope middleware and by ``REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY``.

Only non-default values are emitted. The MCP schema defaults are
``readOnlyHint=false``, ``destructiveHint=true``, ``idempotentHint=false``.
The pydantic fields are snake_case (MCP SDK v2); the camelCase names above
are what appears on the wire.

Maintenance:
    1. When adding a new MCP tool, add it here with the kind that matches
       what it can actually do.
    2. Classification is by effect on Redmine state. A tool that only reads
       Redmine is READ even if it writes an ephemeral local cache file.
    3. Mixed ``manage_X(action=...)`` tools take the conservative union of
       their actions. Annotations cannot vary by the ``action`` argument.
    4. Never infer the kind from ``TOOL_SCOPES``. An empty scope set can mean
       either a read or a mutating plugin/local operation.

"""Let an out-of-tree package add MCP tools for an in-house Redmine plugin.

Plenty of Redmine installations run a plugin written for one organization.
Its JSON API is real, its users would like an agent to reach it, and no
public server can carry a tool for it. The alternatives without this module
are a fork, which costs a rebase on every release, or a second MCP server
next to this one, which doubles the auth setup. So instead a separate Python
package registers its tools here at startup::

    REDMINE_MCP_EXTENSIONS=acme_redmine_mcp.widgets

This module is provisional. Its names and the shape of :class:`ExtensionSpec`
may still change in a minor release while the hook settles, so an extension
should pin the server version it was written against.

``main.py`` imports each named module in order, after the built-in tool
modules and before plugin visibility is applied. The module calls
:func:`register_extension` first and defines its tools second::

    from redmine_mcp_server.extensions import (
        ExtensionSpec,
        ToolKind,
        is_true_env,
        mcp,
        plugin_tag,
        register_extension,
    )

    register_extension(
        ExtensionSpec(
            family="acme_widgets",
            enabled=lambda: is_true_env("REDMINE_ACME_WIDGETS_ENABLED"),
            tool_kinds={"manage_widget": ToolKind.WRITE_DESTRUCTIVE},
            tool_scopes={
                "manage_widget": {
                    "list": frozenset({"view_acme_widgets"}),
                    "create": frozenset({"manage_acme_widgets"}),
                }
            },
            advertised_read_scopes=("view_acme_widgets",),
            advertised_write_scopes=("manage_acme_widgets",),
        )
    )

    @mcp.tool(tags={plugin_tag("acme_widgets")})
    async def manage_widget(action: str, project_id: str) -> dict:
        ...

The order inside the module is not a style preference: ``@mcp.tool()``
reads the tool's annotations out of ``TOOL_KINDS`` at decoration time, so
the entry has to be there before the decorator runs.

This is not a second way to register a tool. An extension's tools go
through the same three tables the built-in ones do -- ``PLUGIN_FLAGS`` for
visibility, ``TOOL_KINDS`` for annotations, ``TOOL_SCOPES`` for scope
enforcement -- so the allow list and the scope middleware, both of which
read those tables, cover them unchanged, and the anti-drift cross-checks
hold them to the same kind/scope agreement (only the assertions that count
this tree's own inventory subtract them). What an extension cannot do is
take a name that is already in one of those tables; that raises and fails
startup, because a silent overwrite of a built-in tool's scope entry is the
one mistake here that opens an endpoint rather than closing one.

The other half of that agreement is checked around the import itself:
``main.py`` compares the tool registry before and after, and refuses a
module that defines a tool no spec of its own declares, declares one it
never defines, gives a tool per-action scopes whose keys are not its
``action`` Literal, redefines a tool this server already had, or defines
one without its family's ``plugin:<family>`` tag. FastMCP's duplicate-tool
policy on ``mcp`` is ``warn``, which logs and replaces, so nothing else
would stop the redefinition.

Read-only mode is the exception, and the one thing a tool here has to
apply itself: nothing in the middleware stack enforces it, so a built-in
write tool either goes through :func:`action_dispatch`, which refuses a
``WRITE`` action under ``REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY``, or opens with its own
``is_read_only_mode()`` guard. An extension's write tools do the same. The
same is true of ``wrap_insecure_content`` on user-controlled text.

Besides the spec, the names in ``__all__`` are the rest of the contract:
the building blocks a tool needs, re-exported without their leading
underscore. An extension ships separately from this distribution and
cannot follow a rename of a private helper, so this module, and not the
private module layout, is what it depends on.

class ExtensionSpec:
    """What one extension family contributes to the server's tables.

    Keyword-only: an extension ships separately from this distribution, so
    the order of the fields must never become something it can depend on.
    :func:`register_extension` type-checks every one of them before any
    table is touched, because a field of the wrong shape shows up much
    later -- as an unannotated tool, or as one scope per character in
    ``scopes_supported`` -- rather than where it was written.

    Attributes:
        family: Name of the family, unique across ``PLUGIN_FLAGS`` and
            across the built-in keys of ``get_mcp_server_info``'s
            ``plugin_flags`` (``_env.SERVER_INFO_PLUGIN_FLAGS``), which
            are not the same set. It becomes the FastMCP tag
            ``plugin:<family>``, which every tool the extension defines
            carries as ``tags={plugin_tag(family)}``.
        enabled: Whether this family's tools are listed. Called on every
            visibility pass, on every :func:`oauth_scopes.advertised_scopes`
            call, and once at startup for the log line, so it reads its
            answer rather than caching it -- usually
            ``lambda: is_true_env("REDMINE_ACME_WIDGETS_ENABLED")``.
        tool_kinds: Tool name -> :class:`ToolKind`, merged into
            ``TOOL_KINDS``. One entry per tool the extension defines, and
            no more: a stale entry is as much a drift as a missing one.
        tool_scopes: Tool name -> the scopes a token must hold, merged into
            ``TOOL_SCOPES``. Either a ``frozenset`` covering the whole tool
            or a ``dict`` keyed by the ``action`` argument, the two shapes
            ``TOOL_SCOPES`` already uses. ``frozenset()`` means any
            authenticated token, which is the honest entry when Redmine
            gates the endpoint on project membership rather than on a
            permission. A ``dict`` has to name exactly the actions its
            tool accepts, and the tool's ``action`` parameter has to be a
            ``Literal`` of them: an action the map does not name resolves
            to no requirement at all and the call reaches the tool
            unchecked, so ``main.py`` compares the keys with the Literal
            after the import and refuses a mismatch, or an ``action`` that
            is not a Literal.
        advertised_read_scopes: Redmine permissions to add to
            ``scopes_supported`` while the family is enabled -- in
            :func:`oauth_scopes.advertised_scopes` and, once ``main.py``
            has refreshed the auth provider, in the documents served at
            ``/.well-known/`` that a client actually consents against.
            Needed only for a permission this server does not advertise
            already, which in practice means one the plugin declares
            itself. An ordered sequence, and never a bare ``str``: a
            ``str`` is a sequence of its own characters, so one would
            advertise a scope per letter.
        advertised_write_scopes: The same, and additionally suppressed in

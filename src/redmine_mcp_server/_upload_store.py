"""Staging area for files a caller uploads over HTTP, before they reach Redmine.

The point of this module is what it keeps *out* of the conversation. An MCP
client cannot pipe a file into a tool argument: whatever ends up in
``content_base64`` is written by the model, character by character, and a
payload of a few thousand characters does not reliably survive that (#305).

So the bytes take the side channel this server already uses in the other
direction. ``/files/{file_id}`` hands out a downloaded attachment against an
unguessable id; ``POST /uploads/{upload_id}`` accepts one against a
single-use ticket. The model sees a path in a shell command and a UUID coming
back, and nothing long passes through it.

Staged files live under ``ATTACHMENTS_DIR`` in the same UUID directories with
the same ``metadata.json`` shape the download path writes, so
``AttachmentFileManager`` expires and sweeps them without knowing they exist.

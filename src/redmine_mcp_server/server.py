"""FastMCP server instance.

The single source of truth for the `mcp` object that all `@mcp.tool()`
decorators register against. Tool modules import `mcp` from here.

Importing this module does NOT register any tools -- only `tools/__init__.py`
(via `from . import tools` in `main.py`) triggers tool registration.

In OAuth mode (``REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth``), the FastMCP instance is
constructed with a ``RemoteAuthProvider`` that validates Bearer tokens
against Doorkeeper's RFC 7662 introspection endpoint. In OAuth proxy mode
(``REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth-proxy``), FastMCP's ``OAuthProxy`` handles client
registration and the authorization code flow, then validates upstream Redmine
tokens with the same introspection endpoint. In legacy mode the instance is
built without ``auth=`` and behaves as before.

    Every builder snapshots the list into the provider it returns, and

    ``main.py`` has imported the modules ``REDMINE_MCP_EXTENSIONS`` names.
    So an extension's scopes reach ``advertised_scopes()`` but not the
    served discovery documents unless the provider is told again. All three
    providers read their list when ``get_routes()`` builds the HTTP app,
    which is after extensions load, so one call is enough.

    Each mode keeps the source its own builder used:
    :func:`oauth_scopes.advertised_scopes` for the OAuth proxy (whose
    ``valid_scopes`` is what it registers clients against) and
    :func:`oauth_scopes.configured_advertised_scopes` for the remote
    provider and for ``api-key-login`` (so ``REDMINE_MCP_SCOPES`` still
    narrows both). ``None``, the legacy modes, has nothing to refresh.

    Any other provider fails startup if an extension declared scopes to
    advertise. Left alone it would keep the narrower snapshot, so the
    discovery documents would omit those scopes and, in a mode that grants
    from the same list, every tool requiring one would be denied with
    nothing in the log to say why. A provider nothing was declared for has
    nothing to lose and is left as it is.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.16.0] - 2026-09-19
### Added
- `manage_redmine_project` creates, edits, closes and reopens projects, taking
  Redmine's own `Project` safe attributes (`identifier` is create-only). Every
  write reads the project back, so a field Redmine dropped for lack of
  permission shows up instead of looking applied. Archiving and deletion are
  not offered ([#307](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/307), [#308](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/308)).
  **OAuth deployments: before starting the upgraded server, tick six new
  permissions on the Redmine OAuth Application** (`add_project`,
  `add_subprojects`, `edit_project`, `close_project`,
  `select_project_publicity`, `select_project_modules`), or new authorizations
  fail with `invalid_scope`. Existing tokens keep working. The last two are
  optional: without them only `is_public` and `enabled_module_names` cannot be
  edited.
- `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=api-key-login` gives each user their own Redmine identity
  on a Redmine without OAuth, such as Easy Redmine or Redmine before 6.1. MCP
  clients connect with just the server URL; on first use the user pastes their
  Redmine API key into a login page, and it is stored encrypted and used for
  their tool calls. Passwords are never accepted and administrator keys are
  refused by default. `REDMINE_API_KEY_LOGIN_BINDING_CRYPTO=token-derived`
  optionally keeps stored keys unreadable even to someone holding both the
  store and the signing key. Setup and security model:
  [docs/api-key-login-auth.md](docs/api-key-login-auth.md)
  ([#261](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/261), [#286](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/286), [#287](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/287),
  [#299](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/299)).
- `REDMINE_MCP_EXTENSIONS` imports named Python modules at startup, so a
  separate package can add tools, for example for an in-house Redmine plugin.
  The hook is provisional: [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md)
  ([#294](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/294), [#295](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/295)).
- A file on the caller's machine can reach `uploads` without passing through
  the model. `create_upload_ticket` returns a single-use upload URL and ticket;
  the caller sends the file in one HTTP request to `POST /uploads/{upload_id}`
  and passes the returned `upload_id` to any tool that takes `uploads`.
  Previously such a file could only arrive as `content_base64` retyped by the
  model, which was seen to corrupt a PNG and still report success. Each
  `uploads` item also accepts optional `sha256` and `size_bytes`, checked before
  anything reaches Redmine, and `REDMINE_MCP_CONTENT_BASE64_MAX_BYTES` lets
  operators cap base64 payloads. The docs now list the sources caller-first:
  `upload_id`, `source_url`, `content_base64`, `file_path`
  ([#303](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/303), [#305](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/305), [#306](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/306)).

### Fixed
- `legacy-per-user` mode refuses a wrong or reset `X-Redmine-API-Key` with
  `PER_USER_AUTH` instead of silently running as the anonymous user. Accepted
  keys are cached for 5 minutes, so a key reset within that window can still
  see the anonymous view; Redmine's "Authentication required" setting closes
  the gap ([#290](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/290)).
- `AUTO_CLEANUP_ENABLED` now defaults to `true`, as documented. The code read
  an unset variable as `false`, so cleanup never ran unless it was set. Set it
  to `false` to keep the old behavior
  ([#296](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/296)).
- Expired OAuth state files are now deleted from `FASTMCP_HOME` in
  `oauth-proxy` and `api-key-login` modes. Unauthenticated requests write them,
  so the directory could grow without bound ([#289](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/289)).

### Contributors
- @andilem proposed the `api-key-login` mode and proved it against a production
  Easy Redmine with a working spike
  ([#261](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/261)), reviewed its
  design ([#265](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/discussions/265)),
  and implemented it
  ([#286](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/286),
  [#287](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/287),
  [#299](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/299)). They also
  reported that `uploads` steered agents to `file_path` and that a local file
  could only arrive by being retyped by the model
  ([#303](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/303),
  [#305](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/305)), and built the
  upload-ticket route that fixes it
  ([#306](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/306)).
- @mmahmed proposed and implemented the `REDMINE_MCP_EXTENSIONS` extension point
  ([#294](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/294),
  [#295](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/295)) and the
  `manage_redmine_project` tool
  ([#307](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/307),
  [#308](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/308)).

## [2.15.0] - 2026-09-12
### Added
- `manage_redmine_wiki_page` exposes the wiki page hierarchy. `get`, `create`
  and `update` now report `parent_title` (the same key `list` already
  returned), and `create` and `update` accept it, so pages can be filed under
  a parent and moved between parents. Omitting the parameter leaves an
  existing parent untouched and `""` moves a page back to the wiki root, so no
  existing caller can orphan a page. An unknown parent makes Redmine answer
  422 with an empty error list on both 6.1 and 7.0; that reasonless failure is
  replaced with a message naming `parent_title` as the likely cause
  ([#270](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/270)).
- News tools: `list_redmine_news`, `get_redmine_news`,
  `manage_redmine_news` (create, update) and `delete_redmine_news`. News was
  the last core Redmine resource with no coverage, and there was no
  workaround either -- `search_entire_redmine` could not reach it. Reading
  works on any Redmine; writing needs 4.1, where the REST API gained it.
  Deleting is a separate tool, like `delete_redmine_issue` and `delete_file`,
  so a deployment restricting its tools can offer announcements without
  offering their destruction. Comments come back read-only, because Redmine
  has no endpoint for adding one.
  Three failure shapes get names instead of being passed on: a create whose
  204-with-no-body read-back does not match the title that was sent reports
  `CREATE_UNCONFIRMED` rather than a neighbour's record; a 403 reports
  `NEWS_MODULE_DISABLED` when reading the project's modules back shows the
  news module really is off -- Redmine checks it before any permission and
  refuses an administrator too -- while an ordinary permission denial keeps
  the plain error; and a 404 on create where the project still reads back
  reports `NEWS_WRITE_UNSUPPORTED`, because `News.redmine_version` is
  `(1, 1, 0)` for the whole resource and python-redmine raises no version
  error of its own. That message names the endpoint rather than a core
  version, since distributions vary in what they expose.
  `search_entire_redmine` searches news alongside issues and wiki pages, which
  the module docstring already claimed
  ([#269](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/269)).
- Issue serializers pass through top-level keys the standard Redmine API does
  not define, under `unmapped_fields`. Distributions and plugins add their own
  keys to the issue JSON (Easy Redmine sends `easy_sprint` and
  `easy_story_points`, for example); a serializer built from a fixed key set
  dropped them. The values are read from python-redmine's decoded payload,
  without a lazy fetch. Nulls are dropped, strings are wrapped against prompt
  injection like any other user-authored text, and a value over 1000 characters
  once wrapped and serialized is skipped -- the cap is measured after wrapping
  because that is what reaches the client. `get_redmine_issue`,
  `list_redmine_issues` and `search_redmine_issues` expose the key; it is
  omitted when there is nothing to report, so payloads from a stock Redmine are
  unchanged. The same serializers gain `total_estimated_hours` and
  `total_spent_hours`, stock Redmine fields carrying the subtask rollup that
  `estimated_hours` and `spent_hours` leave out
  ([#263](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/263),
  [#268](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/268)).

### Changed
- Upgraded to FastMCP 4 and the MCP Python SDK v2: `fastmcp>=4.0.1,<5` (locked
  on 4.0.3) pulls in `mcp` 2.1.1 and the new `mcp-types` package
  ([#258](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/258)). The
  migration is mechanical: `ToolAnnotations` are built with the snake_case
  field names the SDK now uses (`read_only_hint`, `destructive_hint`,
  `idempotent_hint`; the camelCase wire format is unchanged) and `ToolResult`
  is imported from its public `fastmcp.tools` path. The `mcp>=1.28.1`
  constraint added for CVE-2026-52870, CVE-2026-52869 and CVE-2026-59950 is
  removed because FastMCP 4 already requires `mcp>=2.0.0`, past every
  affected range. Verified on both sandbox Redmine versions (6.1.1 and 7.0.0)
  and with live `oauth`, `oauth-proxy`, `legacy` runs plus a docker-compose
  build; no behaviour change for users.

### Fixed
- Every tool parameter now reaches `tools/list` with a description, and a test
  keeps it that way. `manage_product` was the worst of it: all 13 of its
  parameters arrived as bare types behind a three-line tool description, which
  hid the split that matters most, since `create` reads the flat parameters and
  `update` reads only `fields`, so the natural call from the schema alone
  (`action="update", product_id=42, price=9.99`) failed with `fields must be a
  non-empty dict`. Its docstring now says which actions each parameter belongs
  to, that `status_id` is 1 or 2 and nothing else, that `limit` is clamped at
  100, and which keys `fields` accepts and silently drops. `manage_deal` and
  `add_deal_product` had described their parameters but paired two of them per
  line (`currency, due_date` and `tax, discount`), which the docstring parser
  does not split, so those four reached the schema empty as well; they are now
  one entry each. The remaining gaps were `manage_contact`'s `action`, the one
  parameter its docstring skipped out of 28, and the `project_id` and `filters`
  of the two MCP Apps backend tools, `get_triage_board_data` and
  `get_project_dashboard_data`, which are called by the board and dashboard
  iframes rather than by a model, so that pair was not costing anyone a failed
  call. With every plugin flag on, all 62 listed tools now describe every
  parameter they expose. The new check in `tests/test_tool_annotations.py`
  walks every registered tool with all plugin families visible and fails on any
  parameter whose schema description is empty; it carries no allowlist, since
  an exemption list is where the next undocumented parameter would hide
  ([#277](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/277),
  [#278](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/278),
  [#281](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/281)).
- `uploads` is documented where a client can read it. `create_redmine_issue`
  and `update_redmine_issue` now describe the parameter in their docstrings,
  so it reaches `tools/list` with its three content sources named instead of
  as a bare array of objects. `docs/tool-reference.md` had described them all
  along, but a client reads the schema, not the repository: an agent holding a
  file could not discover `content_base64` there, followed the one documented
  route it could find (`file_path` on `upload_file`) and hit a wall no
  configuration can open, since that path is read where the server runs rather
  than where the caller does. The upload-roots error now says which filesystem
  it means and names the two sources that need no roots at all, and
  `manage_redmine_wiki_page` carries the same caveat. `upload_file` says which
  machine it means in its docstring and in both places its reference section
  describes `file_path`, in place of "already on the server", wording that
  reads as a fact about the file rather than about the host and sent the
  reporter looking for a configuration fix; both now also point at the issue
  and wiki tools for attaching to a ticket or a page
  ([#275](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/275),
  [#276](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/276),
  [#279](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/279)).
- `oauth-proxy` state now survives a container rebuild. `FASTMCP_HOME` was
  unset by default, so FastMCP resolved its store to the running user's
  platform data directory, which in the image is inside the container
  filesystem: every `docker compose up -d --build` discarded the client
  registrations and upstream token mappings, and every MCP client had to
  reauthorize. Nothing errored, which made it hard to trace back to the
  deploy. The image now sets `FASTMCP_HOME=/app/data/fastmcp`, the directory
  compose already mounts, so a bare `docker run` inherits the right default
  too. In `oauth-proxy` mode the server also logs the resolved state
  directory at startup and warns when `FASTMCP_HOME` is unset, and
  [`docs/oauth-setup.md`](docs/oauth-setup.md) documents the volume
  requirement, the uid 1000 ownership rules for bind mounts and named
  volumes, and that changing `REDMINE_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY` orphans the store
  just as losing the volume does.
  ([#266](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/266))
- Contributor credits are no longer dropped from generated GitHub release
  notes. `_split_contributors` in `scripts/release.py` removed the
  `### Contributors` section from the body and then rebuilt it from a regex
  that required a separator right after the handle, so the current prose style
  (`- @andilem proposed and implemented ...`) matched nothing and the credits
  were deleted rather than merely skipped. v2.14.0 shipped with no Contributors
  block at all for that reason. Two related losses are fixed with it: a
  contributor credited by name rather than by `@handle` no longer disappears
  (v2.13.0 dropped RedmineUP), and wrapped entries keep their continuation
  lines, so credits stop being truncated at the first line and losing the PR
  links the format requires. A `### Contributors` section that parses to
  nothing now fails the release instead of publishing without credit, since
  this class of bug has now shipped three times.

### Contributors
- @andilem proposed and implemented the news tools
  ([#269](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/269)), reported that
  `uploads` never reaches the tool schema, so an agent attaching a file follows
  `file_path` into a wall no configuration can open
  ([#275](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/275)), and
  documented the parameter on the issue tools, the wiki tool and the
  upload-roots error, verified against a Docker deployment behind HTTP
  ([#276](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/276))
- @gino8080 reported that the issue serializers drop the top-level keys
  distributions and plugins add
  ([#263](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/263)) and
  implemented the `unmapped_fields` pass-through with the `total_estimated_hours`
  and `total_spent_hours` mappings, verified against Easy Redmine 11plus.5.1
  ([#268](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/268))

## [2.14.0] - 2026-09-05
### Added
- `REDMINE_MCP_ALLOW_TOOLS` (and `REDMINE_MCP_ALLOW_TOOLS_FILE`) expose only
  the named tools; everything else is hidden from `tools/list` and refused by
  `call_tool` with a `TOOL_NOT_ALLOWED` envelope. Enforced by middleware, so
  the restriction reads no server internals and cannot fail open. It runs
  alongside plugin visibility and only ever narrows, so a listed tool whose
  plugin flag is off stays hidden. A variable that is set but names no tool
  refuses to start; names matching no tool are warned about at startup.
  Granularity is whole tools -- per-action control on `manage_X` tools
  remains `REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY`'s job, and the two compose, so an allow
  list containing write tools with read-only off is how selective write
  access is expressed.
  ([#255](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/255))

### Fixed
- Text files are now read and written with an explicit `encoding="utf-8"` in
  `scripts/release.py` and in the attachment metadata I/O. Without it Python
  picks the locale codec, so on a Windows machine with a cp1252 locale
  `scripts/release.py --sync-contributors` died on `README.md`: the emoji
  variation selector `U+FE0F` encodes as `EF B8 8F`, and `0x8F` is unmapped
  in cp1252. Two `test_release_script.py` cases failed for the same reason.
- `get_redmine_attachment` no longer hardcodes `http://` in the download
  `uri` and no longer appends default ports. The scheme now honors a new
  `PUBLIC_SCHEME` env var, or is derived (`https` when `PUBLIC_PORT=443`),
  and ports 80/443 are omitted when they match the scheme's default, so
  deployments behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy get a usable URL
  without config changes.
  ([#252](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/252))
- `test_cert_path_symlink_resolution` now skips instead of erroring where
  symlinks cannot be created. Creating one on Windows needs
  `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege`, which an ordinary account does not hold
  outside Developer Mode or an elevated shell, so the test failed in its
  setup for every Windows contributor running the suite locally. Guarded the
  same way as `test_resolve_local_file_rejects_symlink_escape`, the suite's
  other symlink test.
- The two MCP Apps UI resources (`ui://redmine/triage-board.html`,
  `ui://redmine/project-dashboard.html`) now declare their Content Security
  Policy in `_meta.ui` on both `resources/list` and `resources/read`, with
  explicit empty `connectDomains` and `resourceDomains` since the views load
  nothing external. Hosts read the CSP from the resource, not the tool, so
  ChatGPT's inspector reported "Widget CSP is not set" for both templates.
  The tool-side metadata now carries the same explicit lists. `domain` is
  deliberately left unset: its format is host-specific (Claude and ChatGPT
  differ), and the MCP Apps spec falls back to the host's own sandbox origin
  when it is omitted.
  ([#249](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/249))

### Contributors
- @aadnehovda reported the missing widget CSP metadata with the ChatGPT
  inspector screenshot ([#204](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/204))
- @andilem proposed and implemented the tool allow list
  ([#255](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/255)), fixed the
  locale-codec text I/O that broke `scripts/release.py --sync-contributors` on
  a cp1252 Windows machine
  ([#257](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/257)), made the cert
  symlink test skip where creating a symlink needs a privilege
  ([#260](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/260)), and reported
  the TLS download URI bug with a precise diagnosis and fix proposal
  ([#252](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/252))

## [2.13.0] - 2026-08-29
### Added
- Full coverage of the RedmineUP CRM PRO REST API. Every one of the plugin's
  24 REST actions is now reachable through the six tools below, verified live
  against CRM PRO 4.4.7 and Products 2.2.9 on Redmine 6.1.1 and 7.0.0, with a
  committed live suite (`tests/test_crm_integration.py`, one test per action,
  run under `--integration`, skipped when the plugin is absent). Tracked in
  [#247](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/247) and [#248](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/248).
- `list_deal_statuses`: deal statuses (rendered `open`/`won`/`lost`) and a
  project's deal categories, the lookups `manage_deal(action="create")`
  needs. The plugin serves statuses to administrators only, so other users
  get the categories plus a `statuses_error` instead of a failure.
- `manage_crm_note`: get, create, update and delete notes on contacts and
  deals (the CRM's activity log). Available with either `REDMINE_CRM_ENABLED`
  or `REDMINE_DEALS_ENABLED`, gated per call on the flag matching the note's
  source; advertises `add_notes`, `delete_notes` and `delete_own_notes` as
  OAuth scopes.
- `manage_deal_category`: list, create, rename and delete a project's deal
  categories, with optional reassignment of affected deals on delete;
  advertises `manage_deals`.
- `list_contact_tags`: tags in use on contacts, with colors, for the `tags`
  filter and `tag_list`.
- `list_crm_queries`: saved contact or deal queries.
- `add_deal_product`: a catalogue or free-form product line on a deal (deals
  and products flags together); `manage_deal(get, include="lines")` returns
  the lines.
- MCP tool annotations on every tool, so clients can tell read-only queries
  from writes. Read tools advertise `readOnlyHint`, which lets annotation
  aware clients skip write-operation approval prompts for ordinary Redmine
  queries; additive tools advertise `destructiveHint=false`. Annotations are
  advisory client metadata: OAuth scope enforcement and
  `REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY` remain the server-side controls
  ([#204](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/204)).
- `list_redmine_projects` returns the six fields Redmine's project index
  renders and the serializer discarded: `homepage`, `parent`, `status`,
  `is_public`, `inherit_members` and `updated_on`. `status` is Redmine's
  integer code (`1` active, `5` closed). `parent` is `{id, name}`, `null`
  when Redmine omits it (top-level, or a parent the caller cannot see). An
  absent key is `null`, never a substituted default
  ([#238](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/238)).
- `list_redmine_projects` can return pagination metadata with
  `include_pagination_info=True`: the same envelope and keys as
  `list_redmine_issues`. `total` is Redmine's own `total_count`, read off
  the same response, so it costs no extra request. A deployment that
  suppresses API metadata (`nometa` or `X-Redmine-Nometa`) truncates the
  read to one page with a total that agrees; this is documented, since no
  client can detect it. The default return is still a bare array
  ([#238](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/238)).
- `list_redmine_projects` gains `filters`, `limit` and `offset` for
  server-side narrowing, above all `{"cf_42": "..."}` for a project custom
  field. `filters` accepts only the filter names `ProjectQuery` registers
  plus the `cf_<id>` spellings, each value a single scalar: Redmine silently
  ignores an unregistered filter key, and a non-filter parameter can be read
  by another part of the request (`key` substitutes the configured API key;
  `uploads` would read and POST a local file). `limit` is capped at 1000 and
  bounded in the schema, and the tool still returns only active projects
  unless `filters` carries a `status`
  ([#238](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/238)).
- `manage_contact` `list` can return the same pagination envelope with
  `include_pagination_info=True`. `total` is the `total_count` already in
  the contacts response (no extra request) and `has_next` is measured from
  it. When no reported total measures the collection, notably under
  `search`, whose total the CRM plugin counts before searching, `total` is
  `null` and `has_next` falls back to the full-page inference, staying a
  boolean a caller can loop on. The default return is still a bare array
  ([#234](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/234)).
- `get_current_user` can return the caller's project memberships via
  `include_memberships=True`, as `[{id, project: {id, name}, roles: [{id,
  name}]}]` with `inherited: true` preserved on a group-inherited role. The
  include rides the existing `GET /users/current.json` call: no extra
  request, no new scope. `groups` is deliberately not offered, since Redmine
  renders it only for admins and silently omits it otherwise
  ([#236](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/236)).

### Changed
- Plugin-gated tools are listed on the MCP surface only when their
  `REDMINE_*_ENABLED` flag is set. A vanilla Redmine now advertises the 45
  core tools instead of 52, which trims client context and removes tools
  that could only answer "feature disabled"; with every plugin on, 13 more
  appear. `get_mcp_server_info.plugin_flags` still reports which families
  are enabled
  ([#247](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/247),
  [#248](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/248)).

### Fixed
- The issue tools build their pagination envelope through the shared
  `_pagination_info` helper
  ([#240](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/240)).
  `has_next` is now measured as `offset + limit < total` instead of inferred
  from a full page, which claimed one page too many whenever the collection
  size was an exact multiple of the page size. The total reads off the same
  response the issues came from instead of costing a second `limit=1`
  request. A `limit` above 100 is passed through whole instead of being
  silently truncated to 100 rows. An unmeasured total is reported as `null`,
  never an estimate, and `search_redmine_issues` now reports `total: null`
  explicitly instead of omitting the key.
- Documentation no longer describes `list_redmine_projects` as listing every
  accessible project. Redmine defaults the query to `status = 1`, so the
  tool has always returned active projects only; the docs now say so and
  give the `filters={"status": "1|5"}` remedy
  ([#238](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/238)).
- `get_current_user` docs named `GET /my/account.json` as the endpoint. The
  call is `GET /users/current.json`, the one that can render memberships.
- `list_project_issue_custom_fields` no longer invents the six metadata keys
  Redmine never sends. The include renders only `id` and `name` per field;
  `field_format`, `is_required`, `multiple`, `default_value`,
  `possible_values` and `trackers` were local defaults, and
  `is_required: false` invited a caller to omit a required field and fail
  the create (the failure #119 reported). Those keys now report `null`,
  documented as "not readable on this token"; the real definitions live on
  an admin-only endpoint no non-admin token can read
  ([#232](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/232)).
- `list_project_issue_custom_fields` returns a `TRACKER_BINDINGS_UNREADABLE`
  error when `tracker_id` is passed and the response carries no tracker
  bindings (on a stock Redmine it never does), instead of silently returning
  an unfiltered list. Where bindings are readable, a field bound to no
  tracker is excluded rather than treated as global
  ([#232](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/232)).
- `list_project_issue_custom_fields` requires the `view_project` scope
  instead of none, matching the `projects#show` request it makes; a token
  without it was refused by Redmine after this server had already admitted
  the call ([#232](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/232)).
- `list_redmine_issues` documents the filter forms it can actually express.
  Redmine carries a filter's operator inside the value and joins alternatives
  with `|`, which the typed parameters cannot represent, so `!*`
  (unassigned), `56|57` and `!4` go through `filters`, which is merged after
  the named parameters and overrides them. That route already worked and was
  undiscoverable: the `filters` entry said it was for "any filter not listed
  above", telling a caller it did *not* apply to those keys, while the tool's
  leading prose offers "find unassigned issues" as a use case. The typed
  parameters are deliberately left alone, since rejecting arbitrary strings at
  the boundary is what [#116](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/116)
  bought ([#250](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/250)).
- `list_redmine_issues` states that a filter Redmine cannot read is not an
  error (it answers 200 with the collection unnarrowed) and that a `cf_<id>`
  needs "Used as a filter" on to be read at all. `list_redmine_projects`
  already carried both; the two tools no longer disagree about a contract they
  share ([#250](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/250)).
- `list_redmine_issues` states what a large `limit` costs: above 100 the
  request is paged in chunks of 100, one request per chunk *asked for*, so a
  ten-issue project read at `limit=1000` costs ten requests to return ten
  rows. The schema advertises 1000 and the reference documented 1000 with
  nothing about the cost, which is an invitation. Not a defect in
  [#241](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/241), which returns
  the correct rows where the old code returned 100 labelled complete; this is
  the sentence that trade needs
  ([#250](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/250)).
- `docs/tool-reference.md` documents `list_redmine_issues`'s `filters`
  parameter, which it had never listed, and the paging cost of `limit`.

### Security
- `list_redmine_issues` and `manage_contact` now validate a caller-supplied
  `filters` dict before forwarding it, the way `list_redmine_projects` has
  since [#239](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/239): keys
  must be filters the resource's `Query` registers (plus `cf_<id>` and its
  chained and association spellings) and values must be scalars. Two
  consequences of forwarding it unchecked are closed. On
  `list_redmine_issues` the dict reached python-redmine's `Issue.bulk_decode`,
  whose `decode` treats an `uploads` key as a list of local file paths to read
  and upload before the list request is issued: a write, and a local file
  read, from a tool that neither the `REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY` gate nor the
  `uploads` scope check covers, because the gate fires only for write actions
  and the scope check reads the write tools' own named parameter. On both
  tools a `key` in the dict reached the query string, where Redmine's
  `api_key_from_request` prefers it over the `X-Redmine-API-Key` header the
  client sets, substituting the identity the request was authenticated with.
  A `limit` or `offset` inside `filters` is still accepted, since some clients
  wrap every parameter that way, but is now bounded like the named parameter
  rather than overriding it (GHSA-xp4v-6gr8-jvwh).

## [2.12.0] - 2026-08-22
### Added
- `manage_deal`, a tool for RedmineUP CRM deals (`list`, `get`, `create`,
  `update`, `delete`), behind a new `REDMINE_DEALS_ENABLED` flag. Advertises
  `view_deals` plus `add_deals`, `edit_deals`, `delete_deals` unless
  `REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY` is set. Requires the CRM plugin's Pro edition and
  the `deals` project module. `list` returns only *open* deals unless
  `status_id="*"` is passed. `price` is sent as a string, since the plugin's
  own parser raises on a JSON number. Deals get their own flag rather than
  riding `REDMINE_CRM_ENABLED` because the Light edition has no deal
  permissions to advertise, and an unsupported OAuth scope breaks consent for
  `manage_contact` too on a Light install
  ([#224](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/224)).
- `manage_contact` gains a `filters` dict on `list` for query parameters the
  signature doesn't name (e.g. `{"cf_42": "x"}` for a custom field). Refuses
  `fields`, `f`, `query_id` (Redmine reads these as the query's own filter
  definition and silently drops every other filter alongside them), and any
  key the signature already validates. `is_company` stays create-only: the
  plugin's filter ignores it regardless of spelling.
- `list_redmine_projects` can return `custom_fields` via
  `include_custom_fields=True`. Redmine already sends these on
  `GET /projects.json`; the serializer previously dropped them. No extra
  request, no new scope required
  ([#230](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/230)).
- `manage_contact` `list` can filter server-side on `first_name`, `last_name`,
  `middle_name`, `company`, `job_title`, `email`, `phone`, `author_id` --
  previously accepted as create-only params and silently ignored on `list`.
  Gated behind a new `REDMINE_CRM_EDITION` setting (`light` default / `pro`),
  since only the CRM plugin's Pro build registers them as query filters; a
  Light install answers `200` with the unfiltered collection for an
  unregistered filter, which looks identical to a filter that matched
  everything. `tags`, `search`, `assigned_to_id` aren't gated: the first two
  work on both builds, the third predates this change. The edition can't be
  auto-detected (Redmine only exposes it via an HTML, admin-only page), so
  the default is the build that registers fewer filters, refusing rather than
  answering wrongly. `filters` (above) is deliberately not gated, since it
  never promised a build honours a given key
  ([#226](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/226)).
- `manage_contact` gets an `offset` parameter to page past the first 100
  contacts ([#226](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/226)).
- `manage_contact` docs now state which parameters apply to which action.
- `list_redmine_issues` can return `custom_fields` and `relations`, both
  opt-in (`include_custom_fields`/`include_relations`, or naming them in
  `fields`), read from the response payload Redmine already sends rather than
  costing one extra request per issue. An `include` passed through `filters`
  is preserved and merged. Defaults unchanged, no new scope required
  ([#228](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/228)).
- `search_redmine_issues` can also select `custom_fields`, since it shares the
  issue serializer. `relations` isn't offered there, as that endpoint never
  requests the include. One asymmetry to note: Redmine filters relations by
  target-issue visibility only on `GET /issues/{id}`, not on the list
  endpoint, so `issue_to_id` in list output can name an issue the caller
  can't read -- resolve it through `get_redmine_issue`, which does apply the
  filter.

### Fixed
- `include=relations` is no longer discarded and re-fetched per issue.
  python-redmine's attribute lookup ignored the already-fetched payload and
  issued `GET /issues/{id}/relations.json`, which needs
  `manage_issue_relations` (not implied by `view_issues`) and is withheld in
  closed/archived projects. Relations now come from the payload:
  `get_redmine_issue(include_relations=True)` works with `view_issues`
  alone, and `get_gantt_chart` drops from one extra request per issue to
  none ([#222](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/222)).
  Each relation now also carries Redmine's `delay` field.
- `delete_redmine_issue` no longer makes unguarded extra requests while
  building its impact preview. All four included collections (`relations`
  always fired; `children` fired for every leaf issue) now come from the
  payload instead of triggering per-attribute requests outside the error
  handling. `time_entries` still needs its own request (Redmine has no issue
  include for it); a caller without `view_time_entries` now sees
  `time_entries_count: null` rather than `0`, which would have understated
  an irreversible cascade.
- `manage_contact` returns the contact fields the CRM API actually sends.
  `custom_fields`, `author`, and `projects` were dropped entirely; `email`/
  `phone` now read the API's `emails`/`phones` arrays (exposed as
  `emails`/`phones`, with `email`/`phone` holding the first entry, and a
  scalar-spelled payload still read as before); `tags` now reads `tag_list`
  instead of the nonexistent `tags` key; `address` passes through the
  plugin's own field names, including `full_address`. `custom_fields` needs
  no new scope
  ([#226](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/226)).
- `manage_contact` no longer fails for every action in OAuth mode. The CRM
  permissions were never advertised as OAuth scopes, so no token could carry
  them even when the user's Redmine role granted access. Setting
  `REDMINE_CRM_ENABLED=true` now adds `view_contacts`/`view_private_contacts`
  plus `add_contacts`/`edit_contacts`/`delete_contacts` unless
  `REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY` is set. **Deployments enabling this flag must grant
  the new scopes on the Redmine OAuth application and have users re-consent.**

### Tests
- New `tests/test_list_issue_custom_fields_and_relations.py`,
  `tests/test_relations_payload.py`,
  `tests/test_project_custom_field_values.py`, and
  `tests/test_contact_payload_keys.py` cover the new list keys and payload
  fixes above, including the fakes for issue relations and contacts now
  serving values the same way the real APIs do (raising on the lazy
  `relations` attribute; using `tag_list`/array `emails`/`phones`), so a
  regression fails in CI instead of only against a live Redmine.
- Unit coverage for `_auth.py` raised from 63% to 100% via new
  `tests/test_auth_revocation.py`, covering the RFC 7009 `revoke_token` proxy
  and the fail-fast branch on a missing `REDMINE_URL` at boot.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-08-15
### Fixed
- Redmine HTTP calls now carry a timeout, configurable with `REDMINE_TIMEOUT`
  (default 30 seconds, `0` disables). Previously no timeout was applied
  anywhere: python-redmine accepts a `requests={"timeout": ...}` setting but
  never passes it to `requests`, so a Redmine that accepted a connection and
  never answered would hang the call indefinitely ([#214](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/214), reported by @Bricklou).
  Connect timeouts are also no longer misreported as connection errors, which
  had blamed the configured URL for an unresponsive server. The same fix
  covers a stalled attachment download: a Redmine that starts sending an
  attachment and then goes silent is now reported as a timeout instead of a
  connection error.
- Blocking Redmine calls no longer stall the event loop. Every tool now runs its
  synchronous section in a worker thread, so a hung or slow Redmine server can
  no longer delay other requests. Previously a single hung call blocked
  everything else for the full `REDMINE_TIMEOUT`: measured against a server that
  accepts connections and never answers, `/health` probed with a 10 second
  deadline failed outright during one hung call, so a liveness probe could
  restart the pod. It now answers throughout. Wrapping the client call alone
  was not enough, because python-redmine issues its request on first iteration
  of a result set and can re-fetch on attribute access, so each tool moves its
  whole synchronous section in one hop ([#216](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/216)).

### Changed
- The README Contributors list is now generated from the `### Contributors`
  credits in this changelog rather than maintained by hand, which had drifted:
  six credited people were missing from it, three of them merged-PR authors.
  The list is regenerated as part of a release, and can be refreshed on its own
  with `python scripts/release.py --sync-contributors` so a credit added
  between releases does not wait for the next version bump. Handles keep the
  position of their earliest credit, so a new name appends rather than
  reshuffling the line.

### Dependencies
- Bump `fastmcp` from 3.4.5 to 3.4.7, a lockfile-only move within the existing
  `<4` bound ([#207](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/207)).
  3.4.7 fixes CIMD `private_key_jwt` client-assertion validation in
  `OAuthProxy`, which had built the expected audience by appending to the issuer
  and produced a doubled slash at a bare origin, so assertions were rejected on
  an audience the authorization server never advertised. That path is reachable
  in `oauth-proxy` mode. 3.4.6 adds `FASTMCP_SSRF_TRUST_PROXY` for deployments
  whose only egress is a corporate CONNECT proxy, where SSRF DNS pinning breaks
  TLS verification. It defaults to `false` and leaves existing behavior
  unchanged. Dependabot originally proposed 3.4.6, which was published three
  minutes before 3.4.7; the PR was retargeted so the assertion fix is not left
  one release behind.
- Bump `starlette` from 1.3.1 to 1.6.0, a lockfile-only move within the existing
  `<2` bound ([#211](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/211)).
  1.5.1 hardens `FileResponse` range handling, rejecting inverted single-byte
  ranges such as `bytes=5-4` and capping a request at 100 ranges, which covers
  the attachment route at `/files/{file_id}`. 1.6.0 adds an opt-in
  `max_body_size` on `Starlette` and the route classes, and exposes
  `http.response.debug` through response extensions. The 1.4.x and 1.5.0 work is
  confined to `GZipMiddleware`, which this server does not install. Retargeted
  from the proposed 1.4.1, three releases behind by the time it was reviewed.
- Bump `requests` from 2.33.1 to 2.34.2, a lockfile-only move within the
  existing `<3` bound ([#209](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/209)).
  2.34.0 ships inline type annotations in place of the typeshed stubs, stops
  greedy matching on `no_proxy` domains, and stops stripping duplicate leading
  slashes in URI paths, the last of which needs `urllib3` 2.7.0 or newer and is
  already satisfied here. 2.34.1 and 2.34.2 settle the new annotations; nothing
  in this project depends on `types-requests`.

### Contributors
- @Bricklou, reported that a call to `get_redmine_issue` hung the MCP server
  against an unresponsive Redmine, which led to both the `REDMINE_TIMEOUT`
  fix and the event-loop offload ([#214](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/214))

## [2.10.0] - 2026-08-08
### Added
- Community health files: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1),
  `SECURITY.md` (private vulnerability reporting, deployment model, and threat
  model), and a pull request template. `docs/contributing.md` updated to
  reference them and to defer the release process to `scripts/release.py`.
- `manage_redmine_wiki_page` now accepts an `uploads` parameter on `create` and
  `update`, so files can be attached to wiki pages
  ([#202](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/202)). Entries take
  the same shape as the issue tools: `file_path`, `source_url`, or
  `content_base64`. Redmine rejects a wiki update with a blank body, so an
  attachment-only update re-reads the page server-side and resends its text
  unchanged, which avoids routing the body through the model and creates no new
  revision. The request carries the version read during that fetch, so a
  concurrent edit returns an edit conflict instead of reverting silently.

### Fixed
- `show_project_dashboard` now shows the project name instead of the raw
  project id in its header and in the "N issues total in X" ring label, matching
  `show_triage_board`. Both apps resolve the label from the fetched issues, but
  the dashboard did not request the `project` field, so the id fallback fired on
  every render.
- SSL settings are no longer overridden by the environment
  ([#197](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/197)). `requests`
  fills an unset per-request `verify` from `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` /
  `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`, and that value beats the session setting, so an ambient CA
  bundle silently re-enabled verification even with `REDMINE_SSL_VERIFY=false`,
  producing `certificate verify failed` right after the
  "SSL verification is DISABLED" warning. Redmine sessions now ignore the
  environment whenever `REDMINE_SSL_VERIFY=false` or `REDMINE_SSL_CERT` is set,
  and carry `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` over explicitly so proxy
  support is unaffected. With SSL configured explicitly, a warning now names
  the variables working against it: an ignored CA bundle, and an `https://`
  proxy in `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY`, whose own certificate is verified
  either way and whose failure is reported against the Redmine host.
- `REDMINE_SSL_VERIFY`, `REDMINE_SSL_CERT`, and `REDMINE_SSL_CLIENT_CERT` are
  now honored by the httpx call sites: attachment downloads,
  `get_mcp_server_info`, the `/health` probes, and OAuth token revocation.
  These previously used httpx defaults, so they failed against a Redmine server
  with a self-signed or private CA certificate. Downloads apply the settings
  only when the URL points at the configured Redmine host, so a relaxed setting
  never follows a redirect to a third-party host.
- `manage_redmine_wiki_page` no longer fails against Redmine 7.0 with
  `'dict' object has no attribute 'id'`. Redmine 7.0 added a `project` ref to
  the wiki page API response
  ([Redmine #43569](https://www.redmine.org/issues/43569)), and python-redmine
  hands that field over as a plain dict rather than a resource object, so
  serializing it raised. This broke `get`, `create`, `update`, and `rename`:
  the write actions changed the page and only then failed, reporting an error
  for a change that had in fact been applied. The ref is now read in either
  shape and those actions return the page again. `list` and `delete` were
  unaffected, as are Redmine versions before 7.0, which omit the field.

### Dependencies
- `requests` is now a declared direct dependency (`>=2.31.0,<3`). The server
  configures `requests` sessions itself for the SSL fixes above, so it was
  relying on it directly while only receiving it transitively.
- Bump `cryptography` 49.0.0 to 50.0.0, widening the ceiling to `<51`
  ([#198](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/198)), and `uvicorn`
  0.51.0 to 0.52.1, a lockfile-only move within the existing `<1` bound
  ([#199](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/199)).
- Bump the pinned GitHub Actions: `actions/checkout` to v7.0.1 and
  `actions/setup-python` to v7.0.0 across all workflows. The Pages workflow's
  actions (`checkout`, `configure-pages`, `upload-pages-artifact`,
  `deploy-pages`) were still on floating major tags and are now pinned to
  commit SHAs like the rest.

### Tests
- Integration coverage for the `redmine_drawio` macro, gated on a new test-only
  `REDMINE_DRAWIO_ENABLED=true` flag. Wiki uploads were covered only for plain
  files, leaving the diagram path to manual verification. The test uploads a
  `.drawio` file alongside `{{drawio_attach(...)}}` and then asserts against the
  rendered wiki HTML rather than the REST response, which returns raw wiki
  source and so cannot show whether the macro expanded: it checks that a diagram
  container is present, that the macro text did not survive into the page, that
  Redmine reported no macro error, and that the uploaded XML reached the output.
  Unlike the agile and tags flags, this one is never read by the server, since a
  `.drawio` upload is an ordinary binary attachment as far as the API is
  concerned. `docs/contributing.md` now lists all three plugin-gated flags and
  what each covers.

### Contributors
- @azelcs — diagnosed and fixed the Redmine 7.0 wiki page serialization crash,
  including the silent dict-ref data loss in `_named_ref`
  ([#200](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/200))
- @fionnb — reported that SSL verification still failed with
  `REDMINE_SSL_VERIFY=false`, with logs and a `tools/call` repro that showed the
  disabled-verification warning immediately followed by
  `certificate verify failed`
  ([#197](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/197))
- @goizper — reported the missing `uploads` parameter on wiki pages
  ([#202](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/202))

## [2.9.0] - 2026-08-01
### Added
- Write support for agile sprint and position via `update_redmine_issue`
  ([#193](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/193)):
  `agile_sprint_id` (set to `0`/null to remove the issue from its sprint) and
  `position` may now be set, given either top-level in `fields` or nested under
  an `agile_data_attributes` dict, routed to the RedmineUP Agile plugin endpoint
  the same way `story_points` already was. Previously `agile_sprint_id` was
  silently dropped, so issues could not be moved to/from a sprint through the
  MCP server. Writes are applied in place — the current `agile_data` row (id and
  existing values) is carried forward — so changing one agile field never nulls
  the others. The updated issue is augmented with the resulting `story_points`,
  `agile_sprint_id`, and `agile_position` so the change can be verified from the
  response.

### Fixed
- `update_redmine_issue` no longer accepts an unusable `agile_data_attributes`
  value in silence. A value that is not an object, or one carrying a key outside
  the writable agile fields, now returns an error naming what was rejected
  instead of reporting success for a write that never happened.
- A failed read of the current `agile_data` row no longer falls back to a write
  that replaces the row. Only a missing row (HTTP 404) takes the create path;
  any other error is surfaced, so a transient failure cannot null the agile
  fields it was unable to read.

### Contributors
- @knasiotis — reported the dropped `agile_sprint_id` write and implemented
  agile sprint/position support, including the in-place `agile_data` fix
  ([#194](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/194))

## [2.8.0] - 2026-07-25
### Added
- Opt-in self-AS OAuth discovery profile ([#188](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/188)):
  set `REDMINE_OAUTH_DISCOVERY_AS=self` so the server advertises itself as the
  authorization server (issuer = `REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL`) and serves RFC 8414
  metadata at its own canonical well-known location, while authorize and token
  requests still target Redmine `/oauth/*`. Lets clients that probe the
  authorization server's canonical location (e.g. Cursor) complete OAuth in
  stock `oauth` mode. Default (`redmine`) behavior is unchanged.
- Advertise a subset of OAuth scopes in discovery via `REDMINE_MCP_SCOPES`
  ([#189](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/189)): when the
  Redmine OAuth Application enables only a subset of permissions, advertising a
  matching `scopes_supported` avoids `invalid_scope` at consent for clients
  that request the full advertised list.

### Security
- OAuth token scopes are now enforced on MCP tool calls ([#185](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/185)):
  each tool requires the Redmine permission scopes it uses (per-action for
  `manage_X` tools), unmapped tools are denied by default, `tools/list` is
  filtered to the token's scopes, and the `admin` scope bypasses the check.
  Enforcement is on by default; set `REDMINE_OAUTH_SCOPE_ENFORCEMENT=off`
  as a temporary bridge while re-consenting tokens issued before this
  release (see docs/oauth-setup.md, "Scope Enforcement"). Reported by
  @stevehollis-orderflow.

### Contributors
- @stevehollis-orderflow — reported that OAuth token scopes were advertised but not enforced on tool calls ([#185](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/185)), the Cursor OAuth discovery incompatibility ([#188](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/188)), and the scope-subset gap ([#189](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/189)), each with a precise repro and a sound fix design

## [2.7.0] - 2026-07-20
### Added
- Interactive `project-dashboard` MCP App: the new `show_project_dashboard`
  tool renders a live project snapshot (open vs closed, overdue, due this
  week, an open-by-priority breakdown, and recent activity) as an
  interactive dashboard in clients that support the MCP Apps extension,
  backed by a `ui://` HTML resource over the existing streamable-HTTP
  transport. Clicking any figure drills into the matching issue list
  in-panel; a Refresh action re-fetches through the app-callable
  `get_project_dashboard_data` tool. Read-only.
- Python 3.14 support: 3.14 is now in the CI test matrix and declared in the
  package classifiers. The locked `watchfiles` dependency (pulled in via
  `fastmcp`) was upgraded from 1.0.5 to 1.2.0, the first line with cp314
  wheels, and two `file_manager` tests that relied on pre-3.14 pathlib
  internals were rewritten to be version-independent.

### Fixed
- Docker container now honors `SERVER_HOST` and `SERVER_PORT`. The Dockerfile
  `CMD` previously hardcoded `--host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` in the uvicorn
  invocation, bypassing `main()` and leaving both env vars ineffective in the
  container. The `CMD` now runs the installed `redmine-mcp-server` console
  script, which reads both vars, and the `HEALTHCHECK` port follows
  `${SERVER_PORT:-8000}`. The runtime image also sets `SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0` as
  a default so an ad-hoc `docker run` without a full env file still binds to a
  reachable address (overridable via `env_file` or `-e`).

### Security
- Raised security floors for two transitive dependencies via `[tool.uv]`
  `constraint-dependencies`, clearing all known advisories from the audit:
  `click>=8.3.3` (PYSEC-2026-2132) and `mcp>=1.28.1` (CVE-2026-52870,
  CVE-2026-52869, CVE-2026-59950). Both are pulled in indirectly and not
  imported directly; each constraint can be dropped once an upstream dependency
  raises its own floor.

### Contributors
- @pdostal — fixed the Dockerfile to respect `SERVER_HOST`/`SERVER_PORT` env vars ([#179](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/179))

## [2.6.0] - 2026-07-11
### Added
- Interactive `triage-board` MCP App (Interactive UI / `ext-apps` track): the new
  `show_triage_board` tool renders a project's issues as a live Kanban board
  grouped by status inside clients that support the MCP Apps extension, backed
  by a `ui://` HTML resource served over the existing streamable-HTTP transport,
  with a Refresh action that re-fetches through the app-callable
  `get_triage_board_data` tool.
  Drag a card to another status column to change the issue's status in Redmine via
  `update_redmine_issue` (an optimistic move that reverts with an explanation when
  Redmine rejects the transition); disabled in read-only mode. The Kanban board
  self-loads and auto-resizes to fit. Projects with more status columns than fit the width scroll
  horizontally with a visible scrollbar, so columns past the third stay reachable.
- `get_redmine_issue` now serializes ten standard Redmine issue fields its
  "full context" output previously dropped: `category`, `fixed_version`
  (target version), `parent`, `start_date`, `due_date`, `done_ratio`,
  `estimated_hours`, `spent_hours`, `is_private`, and `closed_on`. The same
  fields are mirrored in the `list_redmine_issues` / `search_redmine_issues`
  `fields` selector, so they are individually selectable and included in the
  default all-fields output. Values come off the already-loaded issue object,
  so no extra Redmine request is made, and each field degrades to `None` when
  unset. ([#174](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/174))
- AlphaNodes `additional_tags` plugin support (opt-in via `REDMINE_TAGS_ENABLED`,
  off by default): `get_redmine_issue` returns a `tags` array (list of
  `{id, name}`), and `create_redmine_issue` / `update_redmine_issue` accept a
  `tag_list` (a list of names or a comma-separated string; `[]` clears all
  tags). The `tag_list` is extracted before custom-field resolution so it never
  collides with a same-named custom field. Under `oauth` / `oauth-proxy` the
  `view_issue_tags` read scope (plus `create_issue_tags` / `edit_issue_tags`
  outside read-only mode) is advertised only when the flag is enabled, and
  `get_mcp_server_info` reports the `tags` plugin flag. Silently ignored when
  the flag is off. ([#175](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/175))
### Fixed
- `list_redmine_issues` total-count query is now bounded to a single request.
  When `include_pagination_info=True`, the count query was built without a
  limit, so python-redmine's ResourceSet materialized every matching issue
  (chunk-by-chunk, dozens of sequential API requests for a large project) just
  to read `total_count`, which could exceed the MCP `tools/call` timeout (seen
  as "tools/call timed out" in the triage board's Kanban view). Redmine returns
  the full `total_count` in the first page of any filtered response, so the
  count query now fetches a single issue (`limit=1`) instead of the whole
  result set.
- OAuth agile fields under `REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED`: when the agile feature is
  enabled, the server now advertises the `view_agile_queries` scope in its
  OAuth discovery documents so issued tokens can reach
  `AgileBoardsController#agile_data`. Previously the agile scope was excluded
  along with other plugin scopes, so `get_redmine_issue` under `oauth` /
  `oauth-proxy` mode always got a Redmine 403 for agile data (silently
  swallowed) and never returned `story_points`, `agile_sprint_id`, or
  `agile_position`. The scope is gated on the same `REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED`
  flag, so non-agile deployments never advertise a scope Redmine cannot
  resolve.
- Compatibility with fastmcp 3.4.3: the argument-validation middleware now also
  unwraps fastmcp's own `ValidationError` (which since 3.4.3 wraps the underlying
  pydantic error as its `__cause__`), so invalid tool arguments keep returning the
  clean `INVALID_ARGUMENTS` envelope instead of a raw pydantic error dump. Still
  compatible with earlier fastmcp 3.x releases.
### Contributors
- @LaurensRietveld — reported the missing OAuth agile scope and diagnosed the root cause ([#173](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/173)); expanded the full-issue serializer with standard issue fields ([#177](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/177)); and added optional AlphaNodes `additional_tags` plugin support (read + write) ([#178](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/178))

## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-04
### Added
- `create_redmine_issue` and `update_redmine_issue` now accept an `uploads`
  parameter to attach files to an issue (and to a journal note when combined
  with `notes`), resolving each file from `content_base64`, `source_url`, or a
  new on-disk `file_path` source.
- `upload_file` gains a `file_path` source for files already on the server.
- New `REDMINE_MCP_UPLOAD_FILE_ROOTS` setting to allowlist `file_path` upload
  directories (defaults to `ATTACHMENTS_DIR`).
- `legacy-per-user` auth mode: per-request Redmine API key via an
  `X-Redmine-API-Key` header, for Redmine instances too old for OAuth. Opt-in
  and fail-closed (`REDMINE_PER_USER_TRUST_PROXY` required); keys are redacted
  from logs; optional identity audit via `REDMINE_PER_USER_AUDIT_IDENTITY`.
- `tracker` field in issue serialization and the `fields` selector for issue listing/search tools.
- `list_project_trackers` tool for project-scoped tracker discovery.
- `create_checklist_item` tool (RedmineUP Checklists) and `is_section` in checklist output.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-27
### Added
- Promotional demo page under `pages/`, deployed to GitHub Pages on version tags via a new `deploy-demo.yml` workflow. It is a scripted, client-side walkthrough of an AI agent triaging a sample Redmine sprint backlog (list, read, reassign, comment, log time, close), with tool-call request/response JSON that matches the server's real response shapes, a Kanban board that updates as the agent works, and a light/dark theme toggle. No live Redmine is connected.

### Fixed
- `get_redmine_issue` now returns journal field-change `details` (status, assignee, custom-field edits) and no longer drops journals that have no note text. The `_journals_to_list` helper previously skipped any journal whose `notes` was empty via `if not notes: continue` and never serialized the `details` array, so field-only history was lost and `details` was missing even on journals with notes. Journals are now kept when they have a note **or** field-change details, and each entry includes `details` (`property`, `name`, `old_value`, `new_value`) plus `private_notes`. `get_private_notes` exposes `details` as well. ([#161](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/161))

### Security
- Add a direct `joserfc>=1.6.7,<2` floor to clear CVE-2026-48990 (CWE-400 uncontrolled resource consumption). `joserfc` 1.3.4 through 1.6.5 fails to apply `JWSRegistry.max_payload_length` to RFC 7797 unencoded (`b64=false`) JWS payloads, allowing oversized payloads to be deserialized; the fix landed in 1.6.6. `joserfc` is a transitive dependency via `authlib` and `fastmcp`, so the direct floor ensures the fix reaches PyPI installs, not only the pinned lockfile. The lock now resolves `joserfc` 1.7.1.
- Free-form journal field-change values now receive the same prompt-injection wrapping as journal notes. Custom-field values (`cf`), `description`/`subject` edits, and attachment filenames in `details` are wrapped in `<insecure-content-{boundary}>` tags, so the newly surfaced field-change history cannot smuggle injected instructions past an LLM consumer. Structured values (status, assignee, priority IDs, dates, numbers) are left raw to avoid bloating output with boundary tags. ([#161](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/161))

### Tests
- `test_scope_advertising_subset_of_sandbox_scopes` now asserts the introspected test token is active before checking scope overlap. A stale `REDMINE_OAUTH_TEST_TOKEN` introspects with an empty scope, which previously made the test fail with a misleading "name drift between oauth_scopes.py and live Doorkeeper config" message; the active-token guard surfaces the real cause (re-mint the bearer) instead.

### Contributors
- @martindglaser — fix missing journal field-change details in `get_redmine_issue` ([#163](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/163))

## [2.3.1] - 2026-06-20
### Security
- Bump `python-multipart` 0.0.29 to 0.0.32 to clear CVE-2026-53539 and CVE-2026-53538 (both fixed upstream in 0.0.30). The direct floor in `pyproject.toml` is also raised from `>=0.0.27` to `>=0.0.30` so the fix reaches PyPI installs, not only the pinned lockfile. ([#150](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/150))
- Bump `starlette` 1.0.1 to 1.3.1 to clear four advisories: CVE-2026-48818 and CVE-2026-48817 (fixed in 1.1.0), CVE-2026-54282 (1.3.0), and CVE-2026-54283 (1.3.1). `starlette` is now also a declared direct dependency (the server imports it directly) with a `>=1.3.1` floor, so PyPI installs cannot resolve a vulnerable version. Dependabot does not propose transitive bumps on its own, so this was applied manually. ([#162](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/162))
- Bump `cryptography` 46.0.7 to 49.0.0 to clear GHSA-537c-gmf6-5ccf (fixed in 48.0.1). `cryptography` is a transitive dependency via `authlib` and `joserfc`; a direct `>=48.0.1` floor is added to `pyproject.toml` so the fix reaches PyPI installs. ([#162](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/162))

### Changed
- Remove the unused `fastapi[standard]` dependency. The server is built directly on Starlette, FastMCP, and Uvicorn and never imported FastAPI, so dropping it removes a large unused transitive tree (`typer`, `sentry-sdk`, `jinja2`, `uvloop`, `fastapi-cli`, `orjson`, `ujson`, and others) from installs. `starlette` is now declared directly to keep the dependency it actually uses explicit. The PyPI `Changelog` project URL now points at the `develop` branch instead of a stale `master` path.
- Rewrite the package description to state what the server does ("MCP server that lets AI assistants manage Redmine issues, projects, wikis, and time tracking") instead of marketing adjectives, applied consistently across `pyproject.toml`, `server.json`, and the GitHub repository description.
- Update PyPI trove classifiers to match the project's status: `Development Status` moves from `4 - Beta` to `5 - Production/Stable`, and `Python :: 3 :: Only`, `Bug Tracking`, `System Administrators`, `OS Independent`, and `Web Environment` classifiers are added for accuracy and discoverability.
- Bump runtime dependencies `fastmcp` 3.3.1 to 3.4.2 ([#152](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/152)) and `uvicorn` 0.48.0 to 0.49.0, which pulls `httptools` 0.8.0 ([#151](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/151)). The OAuth discovery and introspection paths were smoke-tested under FastMCP 3.4.2.
- Bump development and CI tooling: `pytest` 9.0.3 to 9.1.1 ([#160](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/160)), `pytest-asyncio` 1.3.0 to 1.4.0 ([#143](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/143)), `actions/checkout` to 6.0.3 ([#142](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/142)), `astral-sh/setup-uv` to 8.2.0 ([#149](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/149)), and `codecov/codecov-action` 6.0.1 to 7.0.0 ([#148](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/148)).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-12
### Added
- New opt-in authentication mode `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth-proxy`, backed by FastMCP's `OAuthProxy`. In this mode the MCP server is the OAuth authorization server that MCP clients talk to (serving Dynamic Client Registration plus `/authorize`, `/token`, and `/register`) and proxies the upstream flow to Redmine/Doorkeeper, keeping user consent on Redmine via `require_authorization_consent="external"`. This supports clients that require DCR or CIMD without Redmine having to serve RFC 8414 metadata or implement DCR, which the existing `oauth` (introspection) mode could not provide on split-host deployments. The existing remote-auth setup is refactored into a `RedmineAuthProvider`, `/health` now probes Redmine introspection in both `oauth` and `oauth-proxy` modes, and the app supports mounting behind a public base path via `REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL`. Token validation continues to use Doorkeeper introspection, and secrets may be supplied via `*_FILE` env vars for Docker/Kubernetes. Legacy and `oauth` modes are unchanged and `legacy` remains the default; the new mode also requires a stable `REDMINE_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`. See [`docs/oauth-setup.md`](docs/oauth-setup.md) for setup. ([#153](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/153))
- `oauth-proxy` mode restricts client redirect URIs to loopback by default (`http://localhost:*`, `http://127.0.0.1:*`). Since MCP clients register their own redirect URI via DCR, this prevents a registered client from pointing the flow at a remote target out of the box. Set `REDMINE_MCP_ALLOWED_CLIENT_REDIRECT_URIS` to a comma- or space-separated list of glob patterns for hosted clients, or `*` to accept any redirect URI. `docs/oauth-setup.md` also documents that OAuthProxy state is stored node-locally, so the mode is single-replica / sticky-session unless a shared `client_storage` backend is configured.

### Changed
- Secret `*_FILE` env vars (for example `REDMINE_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE`) now raise a clear error naming the variable and path when the referenced file cannot be read, instead of surfacing a bare `FileNotFoundError`. `docs/oauth-setup.md` also notes that when the upstream `oauth-proxy` client falls back to the introspection client, that client must have the authorization code grant and the `/auth/callback` redirect URI configured.

### Fixed
- `python tests/run_tests.py --all` now actually runs the integration suite. The test hermeticity guard introduced in 2.2.0 blanks `REDMINE_*` environment variables for any run that is not an explicit `-m integration` invocation, so the single unmarked `--all` command was treated as a unit run and silently skipped every integration test. `--all` now runs the unit phase (`-m "not integration"`) and the integration phase (`-m integration`) as two separate pytest processes so each gets the correct environment; integration coverage is appended. ([#156](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/156))

### Documentation
- `docs/oauth-setup.md` Step 4 now shows the correct authorization-server metadata path per mode. In `oauth-proxy` mode the issuer is `REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL`, so RFC 8414 metadata is served at the root `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`; the `/mcp`-suffixed path used by `oauth` mode 404s there and previously read as a failure during verification. ([#140](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/140))

### Contributors
- @aadnehovda, designed and implemented the `oauth-proxy` authentication mode backed by FastMCP `OAuthProxy`, and refactored the remote OAuth setup into `RedmineAuthProvider` ([#153](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/153))
- @timcomport, verified the `oauth-proxy` mode end to end on a split-host VS Code + Redmine 6.1.1 deployment and caught the Step 4 authorization-server metadata path discrepancy ([#140](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/140))

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-06
### Security
- Pin `pyjwt[crypto]>=2.13.0,<3` to pull the fix for four advisories in 2.12.1: SSRF via `PyJWKClient` non-HTTP URL handlers (CVE-2026-48522), unbounded JWKS fetches driven by an unverified `kid` header (CVE-2026-48524), incorrect detached-JWS (`b64:false`) payload decoding (CVE-2026-48525), and HMAC/asymmetric algorithm confusion where an issuer public key is accepted as the HMAC secret (CVE-2026-48526). `pyjwt` is a transitive dependency via `mcp`, so it had no direct floor before this. Verified the 2.13.0 release is published by pyjwt maintainer Jose Padilla.

### Added
- `get_mcp_server_info` now returns `current_user` (`{id, login, name}`) for the authenticated Redmine user, or `null` when Redmine is unreachable. This lets a caller see who `assigned_to_id="me"` resolves to, which matters when a shared or robot API key is in use and `"me"` is not the human operator. The `list_redmine_issues` `assigned_to_id` docs now point to `get_mcp_server_info` when `"me"` queries return unexpectedly empty. ([#139](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/139))
- `/health` in legacy mode now probes `GET /users/current.json` to verify the configured credentials and reports the result under `checks.redmine`: `"ok"` when accepted, `"unreachable"` with `status: "degraded"` on auth failure, and `"unconfigured"` with `status: "ok"` when no URL or credentials are set. Auth misconfiguration now surfaces at the health check instead of only on the first failed tool call. The response stays HTTP 200 so orchestrators keep treating it as a binary liveness probe. ([#139](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/139))
- Docker images are now built and published to the GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/jztan/redmine-mcp-server`) on each release. The release workflow builds multi-architecture images (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) and applies the version tags only after the matching PyPI wheel publishes, so a release never produces an image without its wheel. Pull `:latest`, a pinned `:X.Y.Z`, or a minor series `:X.Y`. Requested by @Bricklou ([#141](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/141)).

### Fixed
- `create_redmine_issue` no longer returns the bare `"Requested resource not found."` message when the create request gets an HTTP 404. A 404 on a create POST is anomalous: it generally comes from the deployment or from Redmine itself rather than a genuinely missing resource (for example a sub-URI/Passenger deployment, a reverse proxy, or a plugin or controller filter on the create path), so Redmine can process the POST and create the issue while the client still sees a 404. The bare message invited blind retries and risked silent duplicate issues. The tool now returns a message explaining the issue may have been created and advising the caller to check Redmine before retrying. ([#146](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/146))
- `scripts/release.py` now recognizes comma-separated contributor entries (`- @user, did X`) when building the GitHub release notes. The author-parsing regex previously accepted only colon, hyphen, en dash, and em dash separators, so comma-style entries failed to parse and the generated `## Acknowledgements` block came out empty. This silently dropped the Contributors credits from the v2.0.1 and v2.1.0 GitHub releases (the CHANGELOG entries themselves were unaffected); both releases have been backfilled.
- OAuth mode: the `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/mcp` discovery document now reports `issuer` as the Redmine URL instead of the MCP server's own base URL. On a split-host deployment (`REDMINE_URL` and `REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL` on different hosts), the previous `issuer` disagreed with `authorization_servers` in the protected-resource document, so a spec-strict client (e.g. VS Code 1.122.1) treated the MCP server as the authorization server and requested `/authorize` on the MCP host, which 404s. The issuer now matches `authorization_servers` and the endpoint URLs, all naming Redmine, per RFC 8414 §3.3. ([#140](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/140))

### Contributors
- @Vitexus, exposed `current_user` in `get_mcp_server_info` and added the legacy-mode Redmine probe to `/health` ([#139](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/139))
- @Bricklou, requested publishing the Docker image to the GitHub Container Registry ([#141](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/141))
- @timcomport, reported and diagnosed the OAuth discovery issuer mismatch on split-host deployments ([#140](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/140))

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-29
### Security
- Bump `starlette` 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 to fix PYSEC-2026-161 (malformed `Host` header handling)

### Changed
- **OAuth mode now uses FastMCP v3 native auth.** The hand-rolled `RedmineOAuthMiddleware` (Starlette `BaseHTTPMiddleware`) is replaced by `RemoteAuthProvider(token_verifier=IntrospectionTokenVerifier(...))`. Token validation moves from `GET /users/current.json` to Doorkeeper's RFC 7662 introspection endpoint (`POST /oauth/introspect`), exposing the token's actual scopes via `AccessToken.claims`. This closes the medium-likelihood `custom_route` middleware-skip-list auth-bypass risk identified in the FastMCP v3 compatibility analysis.

### Breaking
- **Two new required env vars in OAuth mode**: `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID` and `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_SECRET`. Operators register a confidential OAuth client in Redmine and patch Doorkeeper's `allow_token_introspection` block (stock Redmine ships with `allow_token_introspection false`). See [`docs/oauth-setup.md`](docs/oauth-setup.md) Step 2 for the walkthrough. Server fails fast at startup if either env var is missing.
- **Discovery path aliases dropped.** Only the canonical paths remain:
  - `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` (RFC 9728 §3.1 suffix-scoped, mounted natively by `RemoteAuthProvider`)
  - `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/mcp` (path-scoped RFC 8414 form, kept as `custom_route` mirror of Redmine's Doorkeeper AS metadata)

  These previously-served paths now return 404: `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (root), `/mcp/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (prefix), `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (root), `/mcp/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (prefix). Clients should follow `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="..."` headers from 401 responses for RFC 9728 §5.3 compliant discovery.
- **Upstream introspection failures now return 401 instead of 503.** When Doorkeeper is unreachable, the previous behavior was `503 upstream_unavailable`. FastMCP's `IntrospectionTokenVerifier` treats transport failures as auth failures, so clients see 401. Operators monitoring 503 spikes as an upstream-Redmine-down signal should switch to monitoring 401-rate or watch `/health`'s new introspection probe (see Added).

### Added
- `/health` now probes Doorkeeper's introspection endpoint in OAuth mode and surfaces the result as `{"status": "ok"|"degraded", "checks": {"introspection": "ok"|"unreachable", "introspection_detail": "..."}}`. Response remains HTTP 200 so container orchestrators continue treating the endpoint as a binary liveness probe; monitoring systems should inspect the JSON `status` field. Results cached per `HEALTH_INTROSPECTION_TTL_SECONDS` (default 30s) to avoid hammering Doorkeeper on every health check.
- Live OAuth integration test suite (`tests/test_oauth_integration.py`) that exercises real Doorkeeper introspection against a sandbox Redmine. Runs only under `--integration` with sandbox creds, skips cleanly with a clear message when unconfigured. See [`docs/contributing.md`](docs/contributing.md) "Live OAuth Integration Tests".
- Structured warning logs on introspection upstream failures (`introspection_upstream_failure status_code=... url=...`) so log-based alerting can distinguish real upstream issues from per-token 401s.

### Removed
- `src/redmine_mcp_server/oauth_middleware.py` (replaced by FastMCP native auth in `src/redmine_mcp_server/_auth.py`).
- `tests/test_oauth_middleware.py` (replaced by `tests/test_oauth_auth.py` and `tests/test_oauth_discovery.py`).

### Documentation
- `docs/oauth-setup.md`: Step 2 rewritten with a Redmine-specific gotcha. The previously recommended approach of adding a separate `config/initializers/doorkeeper.rb` with a fresh `Doorkeeper.configure` block silently wipes Redmine's entire Doorkeeper configuration (admin_authenticator, resource_owner_authenticator, grant_flows, scopes), because Doorkeeper's `configure` rebuilds the Config wholesale rather than merging. The only safe override is editing the existing `Doorkeeper.configure` block in Redmine's `config/initializers/30-redmine.rb` in place. Also adds a note that `Setting.rest_api_enabled` must be true for Administration → Applications to be accessible.
- `docs/troubleshooting.md`: "all MCP requests return 401" diagnostic flow gains an entry for the standalone-initializer wipe symptom, which is otherwise indistinguishable from a misconfigured introspection client without checking the Doorkeeper warning log.
- `docs/contributing.md`: Reorganized the live OAuth integration test instructions around `.env`-based configuration (which the test module now honors). `python tests/run_tests.py --integration` runs both general and OAuth integration suites. For OAuth-only filtering, the doc points at `python -m pytest tests/test_oauth_integration.py` directly because `run_tests.py` does not forward `-k`-style filters.
- **Docs audit pass** (no behavior changes):
  - `README.md`: Corrected stale tool counts — "44 MCP Tools" → "45 + 1 admin-gated"; "46 tools" header → "45 (+1)"; Issue Operations "(12 tools)" → "(13 tools)" to match `tools/issues.py`.
  - `docs/contributing.md`: Rewrote the architecture section for the v2.1 surface. Removed stale references to `oauth_middleware.py`, the `ContextVar`-based token mechanism, and the `GET /users/current.json` validation path. Added `_auth.py`, `oauth_scopes.py`, `_tool_error_middleware.py` and the missing `tools/documents.py` / `tools/meta.py` modules to the inventory tables. Updated counts: 13 tool modules (was 11), 45 tools + 1 admin-gated (was 43).
  - `docs/tool-reference.md`: Completed the read-only mode tool list in §157-176. The previous summary omitted `copy_issue`, `upload_file`, `delete_file`, `import_time_entries`, `update_checklist_item`, `manage_redmine_version`, and `manage_document` — all of which actually gate writes via `ActionMode.WRITE` per the per-tool sections.
  - `roadmap.md`: Refreshed the Project Status block — v2.0.0 → v2.0.1 current, v2.1 noted as merged-to-develop, test count 1339 → 1365 (1285 unit + 80 integration). Updated "Last Updated" stamp.
  - `docs/oauth-setup.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`, `src/redmine_mcp_server/_env.py`, `src/redmine_mcp_server/_auth.py`, `tests/test_oauth_integration.py`: Unified the operator-facing terminology around "confidential" rather than `protected_resource?`. Doorkeeper's `Application#protected_resource?` is an alias for `confidential?` and isn't a separate UI toggle in Redmine's Admin → Applications form, so describing the requirement as "confidential" matches what operators actually click.

### Dependencies
- Bump `uvicorn` from 0.47.0 to 0.48.0 ([#137](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/137)). Defaults `ssl_ciphers` to `None` (uses OpenSSL defaults) and makes `ProxyHeadersMiddleware` ignore duplicate forwarding headers. No behavioral impact for this server: TLS terminates at the proxy/Docker layer, and proxy-headers middleware is not enabled.
- Bump `fastmcp` from 3.2.4 to 3.3.1 ([#128](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/128)). Includes OAuth proxy hardening (silent-consent AS-in-the-middle guard, redirect URI dot-segment rejection, per-token response cache partitioning), `OAuthProxy.update_scopes()` public API, streamable-HTTP transport shutdown fix, and OTEL semconv compliance for list operations. The 3.3 packaging split (introducing `fastmcp-slim`) preserves all public import paths; 3.3.1 hotfixes a circular-import regression in 3.3.0.
- Bump `uvicorn` from 0.46.0 to 0.47.0 ([#127](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/127)). Upstream adds an `ssl_context_factory` hook, eagerly imports the ASGI app in the parent process, and fixes `fd=0` handling under reload/workers. No behavioral impact for this server.
- Bump `python-multipart` from 0.0.27 to 0.0.29 ([#126](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/126)). 0.0.28 speeds up partial-boundary scanning and caps multipart boundaries at 256 bytes (hardening); 0.0.29 handles malformed RFC 2231 continuations in `parse_options_header`. Transitive via `fastmcp-slim[server]`; no API change.
- Bump `codecov/codecov-action` from 6.0.0 to 6.0.1 ([#125](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/125)). Security patch (VULN-1652) preventing template injection in `run:` steps. Pinned by commit SHA, verified against the upstream `v6.0.1` signed tag from Codecov maintainer thomasrockhu-codecov.
- Bump `black` from 26.3.1 to 26.5.1 ([#129](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/129)). Dev-only formatter. 26.5.0 adds Python 3.15 syntax support (PEP 798, PEP 810); 26.5.1 fixes stable-style edge cases around `# fmt: skip` and inline comments inside annotation subscripts. Published by `psf/black`; no transitive dep changes.
- Bump `astral-sh/setup-uv` from 7 to 8.1.0 across all CI workflows ([#102](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/102)). v8.0.0 is a supply-chain hardening release that drops mutable major/minor tags (`@v8`, `@v8.0`) to prevent tj-actions-style attacks. SHA-pinning practice already in place is unchanged. v8.1.0 adds an opt-in `no-project` input (not used here). Verified SHA against the signed upstream tag from astral-sh maintainer eifinger.

### Fixed
- `tests/test_oauth_integration.py` now calls `python-dotenv`'s `load_dotenv()` at module-import time, so `REDMINE_URL` (and any other config) defined in `.env` is honored by the integration suite without having to re-export the var on the command line. Previously the test module read `os.environ` directly at import time, which meant the suite skipped with "Missing: REDMINE_URL" unless the var was set in the shell, even when it was already in `.env` for the running server.

### Contributors

- @aadnehovda, narrowed the RFC 8414 AS metadata path from root to `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/mcp` so the MCP server no longer claims the root discovery slot when co-hosted with another app ([#135](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/135)).

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-22
### Security
- Bump `urllib3` from 2.6.3 to 2.7.0, patching CVE-2026-44431 and CVE-2026-44432; added explicit lower-bound constraint (`urllib3>=2.7.0,<3`) in `pyproject.toml` to prevent silent regression to vulnerable versions (urllib3 is a transitive dep via `requests` / `python-redmine`, so it had no direct floor before this).

### Fixed
- OAuth discovery documents now advertise `scopes_supported` on both `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`. Without this field, MCP clients fell back to Doorkeeper's default scopes (`view_project`, `search_project`, `view_members`), so tools needing other permissions (`list_redmine_issues`, `get_redmine_issue`, `list_time_entries`, `list_redmine_versions`, `summarize_project_status`, and similar) returned 403 against OAuth-mediated requests. Read-only mode (`REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY=true`) hides write scopes from the advertised list. Resolves [#130](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/130).
- OAuth discovery documents are now also served at path-aliased locations (`/mcp/.well-known/...` and `/.well-known/.../mcp`) so MCP clients that don't query the canonical root paths can still bootstrap the OAuth flow.
- OAuth discovery now advertises Redmine's actual document permissions (`add_documents`, `edit_documents`, `delete_documents`) instead of the inferred-but-nonexistent `manage_documents`. The original #130 fix derived the scope from the `manage_X` pattern used by `manage_wiki`/`manage_versions`/`manage_files`, but Redmine's documents subsystem uses the granular `add_/edit_/delete_` triad (same shape as issues). Redmine 6 / Doorkeeper enforces `enforce_configured_scopes` against `Redmine::AccessControl.permissions`, so advertising `manage_documents` caused `/oauth/authorize` to reject the consent request with `invalid_scope: requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed`, breaking the entire OAuth flow for any client that requested the full advertised scope set. Added a regression guard `tests/test_oauth_scopes.py::test_advertised_scopes_are_real_redmine_permissions` that checks every advertised scope against a committed snapshot of `Redmine::AccessControl.permissions` (`tests/fixtures/redmine_6_permissions.txt`), so future pattern-based inference mistakes fail in unit tests rather than at a customer's consent screen.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-16
### Added
- **`delete_redmine_issue`**: new tool exposing irreversible issue deletion via Redmine's `DELETE /issues/{id}.json`. The MCP surface previously had `create_redmine_issue` / `update_redmine_issue` / `copy_issue` / `get_redmine_issue` but no way to delete, so operators had to drop to the Redmine UI or python-redmine directly. Named to sit alongside the other `*_redmine_issue` lifecycle tools rather than under the `manage_X(action=...)` pattern, since there is only one verb. Mirrors the `delete_file` safety pattern: refuses unless `confirm_delete=True`, with a structured `impact` preview (cascade counts for children, journals, attachments, time entries, inbound relations) in the refusal envelope. Subtask cascade requires a second opt-in (`confirm_delete_with_children=True`) so silent subtask destruction can't happen on a single misclick. Read-only mode blocks the call before any Redmine round-trip. Structured for the agent path (clear error codes `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` / `CHILDREN_PRESENT` / `NOT_FOUND`) and the operator path (explicit cascade preview). 14 tests in `tests/test_delete_redmine_issue.py` cover the gate, the cascade preview, 404 handling at fetch and at delete time, invalid input, and read-only blocking ([#120](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/120)). Tool count: 45 → 46.
- **`get_mcp_server_info`** (no args, always callable): returns `{server_version, read_only_mode, auth_mode, plugin_flags: {agile, checklists, products, crm, dmsf}}`. Surfaced as an MCP tool so an LLM caller can detect deployment lag before relying on a recently-shipped fix -- compare `server_version` against the release / commit you expect. The response intentionally excludes credentials, internal hostnames, and file-system paths; only flags that change *call shape* are surfaced. Package version is sourced from installed metadata via `importlib.metadata`. Drift-guard: a regression test pins the exact set of returned keys plus the plugin-flag inventory so a future leak of `REDMINE_URL` / `REDMINE_API_KEY` / `PUBLIC_HOST` into this response would fail CI loudly ([#124](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/124)). Tool count: 44 → 45.
- **`manage_document`** (gated by `REDMINE_DMSF_ENABLED=true`): single MCP tool covering DMSF (Document Management System for Files) plugin operations via an `action` parameter. Requires the `redmine_dmsf` plugin (GPL v2) on the Redmine server.
  - `action="list"`: list documents in a project (or a specific DMSF folder via `folder_id`); supports `limit` (capped at Redmine's server-side 100/request)
  - `action="get"`: fetch a single document's metadata by `document_id`
  - `action="create"`: upload a new document — two-step under the hood (`POST /uploads.json` to get a token, then `POST /projects/{id}/dmsf/commit_files.json` with metadata). Accepts `content_base64` (raw bytes as base64), `filename`, `title`, `description`, `comment`, `folder_id`, `version`, `custom_fields`. Decoded payload capped at 50 MiB.
  - `action="update"`: update metadata fields (`title`, `description`, `comment`, `custom_fields`) by creating a **new revision** — DMSF is versioned and does not support in-place mutation. DMSF filenames are immutable; to replace file content, `create` a new revision with the same filename.
  - User-controlled fields (`filename`, `title`, `description`, `name`, plus nested `author.name`) wrapped in `<insecure-content>` boundary tags
  - Write actions respect `REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY` and require `_is_valid_project_id` / `_is_positive_int` validation on path parameters
  - Whitelist filtering on `update` rejects unknown / immutable keys (e.g., `filename`) with a clear error pointing at the create-new-revision workaround
  - 31 new unit tests covering feature-flag gating, all four actions, read-only mode, validation paths, base64 decoding errors, size-cap rejection, response shape variants (`{dmsf: [...]}` vs bare list)
- `REDMINE_DMSF_ENABLED` environment variable (default `false`) documented in `.env.example`, `.env.docker.example`, and README
- `_is_dmsf_enabled()` helper in `_env.py`

### Changed
- Renamed `.env.docker` (previously tracked-but-gitignored placeholder, which trapped local edits as ongoing "modified" status and risked accidental commit of real credentials) to `.env.docker.example`, matching the `.env.example` convention. Users now copy `.env.docker.example` to `.env.docker`, which stays untracked. `deploy.sh` and the README quick-start were updated to copy from the new template name.

### Changed
- **List/search tools now return a flat `{"error": ...}` envelope on failure (was sometimes `[{"error": ...}]`)**: before #117 several list-shaped tools (`list_redmine_projects`, `list_project_issue_custom_fields`, `list_redmine_versions`, `list_project_members`, `list_time_entries`, `list_time_entry_activities`, `list_redmine_issues`, and the validation-error paths inside several others) returned their error envelope wrapped in a single-element list to satisfy a strict `List[Dict[str, Any]]` return type. An agent that wanted to distinguish "failed call" from "empty result" had to check `len(result) == 1 and "error" in result[0]` for some tools and `isinstance(result, dict) and "error" in result` for others. After #117 every list/search tool's return type is widened to `Union[List, Dict]` and the failure path returns the flat `{"error": ...}` shape consistently. Backward-incompatible for callers that were keying off the array-wrapped form; the new shape matches the convention every other tool already follows. Drift-guard in `tests/test_list_error_envelope_consolidation.py` parametrizes across the list-tool surface and asserts a controlled exception inside each one produces a dict envelope, never an array ([#117](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/117)).

### Fixed
- **Wiki attachments now expose `content_url` and `author` (cross-tool shape symmetry)**: `manage_redmine_wiki_page(action="get", include_attachments=True)` used to return each attachment without `content_url` or `author`, while `get_redmine_issue(include_attachments=True)` returned both. The asymmetry cost an agent a turn when handing off between the two read paths. Both code paths now route through a single new helper `_attachment_to_dict()` in `_serialization.py`, so the dict shape is identical: `{id, filename, filesize, content_type, description, content_url, author, created_on}`. Wrap policy from #109 is preserved consistently (filename verbatim, description wrapped, author via `_named_ref`), and `content_url` is routed through `_rewrite_to_public_url` (#110) so `REDMINE_PUBLIC_URL` rewriting also applies to wiki attachments now. The shared helper means future attachment-serialization changes touch one site instead of three (issue, wiki, project file all use it -- DMSF still has its own raw-dict serializer because its payload shape differs, but the wrap policy lines up). A regression test in `tests/test_attachment_shape_symmetry.py` pins the canonical key set and asserts the issue and wiki paths produce identical dicts (modulo the wrap-tag nonce on `description`) ([#118](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/118)).

### Added
- **`create_redmine_issue` now accepts custom fields by name in `fields`**: `fields={"Department": "Engineering"}` is resolved to `custom_fields=[{"id": N, "value": "Engineering"}]` automatically, bringing create to parity with `update_redmine_issue`. The shared resolution helper (`_resolve_named_custom_fields` in `_custom_fields.py`) is called from both paths: the update wrapper still does its issue-id-to-project-id lookup, the create wrapper takes `project_id` directly. Ambiguous names raise; values are validated against the field's `possible_values`. Closes the verification-thread asymmetry surfaced during #119 round-8; the validation-error hint is simplified now that the name-keyed shape works on both tools ([#123](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/123)).

### Changed
- **Padded `get_redmine_issue` and `create_redmine_issue` descriptions for tool_search recall**: the first sentence of each docstring now includes synonym phrasings (`get_redmine_issue`: "fetch issue details", "view a ticket", "show a bug report", "get issue with comments"; `create_redmine_issue`: "open a ticket", "file a bug", "submit a feature request", "log a support case", "report a task") so semantic-search-based tool discovery hits them on the call shapes an agent actually reaches for. Eval-driven: \`tool_search\` was missing \`get_redmine_issue\` on common phrasings until a multi-word query like "retrieve single issue with attachments journals" landed. The terse one-liner descriptions were doing too little work given how high-traffic these two tools are. Cross-references to neighbor tools (\`list_redmine_issues\`, \`search_redmine_issues\`, \`copy_issue\`, \`update_redmine_issue\`) added at the same time so an agent landing on the wrong one is steered to the right one without an extra round trip ([#113](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/113)).
- **`import_time_entries.entries` no longer accepts a JSON-string variant**: tightened from `Union[List[Dict], str]` to `List[Dict[str, Any]]`. The string-then-parse path was an MCP oddity (most clients pass arrays natively), introduced a parallel error mode, and prevented the FastMCP boundary middleware from validating per-entry shape up front. Now the schema rejects strings/scalars at the boundary with the standard `INVALID_ARGUMENTS` envelope from #108; direct Python callers passing a non-list hit a defense-in-depth guard with the same shape. Removes one line of unused `import json` from the module ([#114](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/114)).
- **`cleanup_attachment_files` is now operator-gated**: the tool is no longer registered on the default MCP surface. It is admin/cron-style functionality (the background cleanup task in `_cleanup.py` already runs on the `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES` schedule, so an LLM agent should almost never need it) and was creating discovery-noise an agent could waste a turn investigating. Operators driving cleanup through the MCP surface set the new **`REDMINE_MCP_EXPOSE_ADMIN_TOOLS=true`** env var to opt in; the function remains importable directly for internal callers (tests, scripts) regardless of the flag. The underlying background cleanup behavior is unchanged ([#115](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/115)).
- **`create_redmine_issue` / `update_redmine_issue` validation-error envelope now carries a tailored recovery hint**: when Redmine rejects with `"<field> cannot be blank"` / `"is not included in the list"` / `"is invalid"`, the returned error dict is augmented with `missing_required_fields` (parsed names) and a `hint` whose body branches on whether the failing fields are Redmine standard fields, custom fields, or both. **Standard fields** (Subject, Priority, Tracker, Status, Assignee, etc.) get a hint pointing at the top-level / `fields={"priority_id": N}` shape with a pointer to the relevant discovery tool (`list_redmine_issue_priorities` etc.). **Custom-looking fields** get a hint covering the working `extra_fields={"custom_fields": [{"id": N, "value": "..."}]}` shape on create, the name-keyed shape on update, and the `REDMINE_AUTOFILL_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELDS` retry path. The custom-field branch also carries the #119 discovery-mismatch caveat: `list_project_issue_custom_fields` only reflects the field-definition `is_required` flag, while workflow rules, role-based field permissions, and tracker-bound required-field settings can still require fields at create/update time. `list_project_issue_custom_fields` docstring updated with the same caveat plus the create/update recovery asymmetry (name-keyed shortcut on update only; tracked separately in #123) ([#119](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/119)).
- **`manage_document` aligned with the post-#109 / #111 / #112 conventions**: the DMSF document-management tool that landed in PR #104 was prepared before the wrap-policy, bounded-limit, and action-enum changes shipped, so it carried three small drifts at merge time. Cleaned up: (1) `action` is now `Literal["list", "get", "create", "update"]` so the JSON schema exposes the enum to strict MCP clients; (2) `limit` is `Annotated[int, Field(ge=1, le=100)]` so out-of-range values are rejected at the FastMCP boundary by `CleanValidationErrorMiddleware` (#108); (3) `_document_to_dict` now returns `filename`, `name`, `title`, and `author.name` verbatim (only `description` stays wrapped), matching the wrap policy from #109. The three drift-guard fixtures (`tests/test_manage_action_schema.py`, `tests/test_limit_offset_schema.py`, `tests/test_wrap_policy.py`) now cover `manage_document` so future drift fails CI loudly ([#122](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/122)).
- **`list_redmine_issues.assigned_to_id` and `list_time_entries.user_id` now reject arbitrary strings**: both filter parameters used to be typed `Optional[Union[int, str]]` so they could accept the Redmine sentinel `"me"`, but the wide `str` branch also silently accepted any other string (`assigned_to_id="garbage"` returned `[]` -- the classic "agent reasons over the wrong count" footgun). Tightened to `Optional[Union[int, Literal["me"]]]` so the JSON schema renders the string branch as a `const: "me"` enum, and `CleanValidationErrorMiddleware` (#108) rejects out-of-set values at the FastMCP boundary with the standardized `INVALID_ARGUMENTS` envelope listing both accepted shapes. Backward-incompatible only for callers that were passing strings other than `"me"` -- those calls were silently returning empty results, so the new error is strictly an improvement. Write-side `user_id` / `assigned_to_id` parameters (create/update/manage tools, `manage_project_member`, `manage_issue_watcher`, `manage_time_entry`) are unaffected -- they were already correctly typed as `Optional[int]` ([#116](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/116)).
- **Stop wrapping structured-metadata fields in `<insecure-content>` boundary tags**: the wrapping was originally applied to every user-controllable string returned by the server (filenames, display names, short labels) on the theory that any text from Redmine could carry a prompt-injection payload. In practice, the wrapping created downstream friction (filenames had to be stripped before being used as paths/URLs/identifiers; assistant-rendered names showed boundary tags) without materially raising the bar against short-label injection. Following the eval recommendation in #109, the policy is now: **free-text fields stay wrapped** (`description`, `notes`, journal content, time-entry `comments`, wiki page `text`, search `excerpt`, attachment `description`, version/product/contact `description`/`background`); **structured metadata is returned verbatim** (filenames, all `_named_ref` display names -- author, version, project, tracker, status, role, etc. -- issue/checklist subjects, product/contact name fields, codes, identifiers). Affected return shapes: `get_redmine_issue.attachments[*].filename`, `get_redmine_attachment.filename`, `list_files`/`upload_file` filename, contact `first_name`/`last_name`/`middle_name`/`company`/`job_title`/`assigned_to.name`, product `name`/`code`/`project.name`/`category.name`, issue category `name`, project member role `name`, gantt issue `subject` and version `name`. Backward-incompatible for any caller that explicitly stripped wrapper tags from these fields -- such callers can simplify. A pinning regression test in `tests/test_wrap_policy.py` documents both halves of the policy so accidental drift fails CI ([#109](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/109)).

### Added
- **`limit` and `offset` now carry explicit bounds in the JSON schema**: every list/search tool's `limit` and `offset` parameter is now annotated with `Annotated[int, Field(ge=..., le=...)]` (or `Optional[int]` for `journal_limit`, where `None` semantically means "no pagination") so strict MCP clients see the bounds, and out-of-range values are rejected at the FastMCP boundary by `CleanValidationErrorMiddleware` (#108) with the standardized `INVALID_ARGUMENTS` envelope. Previously, three tools (`list_redmine_issues.limit`, `search_redmine_issues.limit`, `get_redmine_issue.journal_limit`) rendered as the `any`-shaped `Optional[int]` with no constraints, and even the `int`-typed ones had no bounds despite their docstrings claiming caps. Affected tools and caps: `get_gantt_chart.limit` (1-500), `get_redmine_issue.journal_limit/journal_offset` (1-1000 / 0+), `list_redmine_issues.limit/offset` (1-1000 / 0+), `list_redmine_users.limit/offset` (1-100 / 0+), `list_time_entries.limit/offset` (1-100 / 0+), `manage_contact.limit` (1-100), `manage_product.limit` (1-100), `search_entire_redmine.limit/offset` (1-100 / 0+), `search_redmine_issues.limit/offset` (1-1000 / 0+). Existing defensive runtime clamping (e.g. `min(limit, 1000)`) is left in place for direct Python callers, where Pydantic validation does not run ([#111](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/111)).
- **`REDMINE_PUBLIC_URL` env var + serializer-layer URL rewrite**: when Redmine is configured with an internal hostname (typical in Docker, e.g. `http://redmine:3000`), the `content_url` it echoes back on attachments is unreachable from MCP clients on the host or the open internet, and a less-careful agent can waste a turn web-fetching it. A new `_rewrite_to_public_url()` helper rewrites any URL whose scheme+host+port matches `REDMINE_URL`'s origin to use `REDMINE_PUBLIC_URL`'s origin instead, preserving path/query/fragment; foreign URLs (CDN-hosted assets, pre-rewritten values) are left untouched. Applied at the serializer layer (`_file_to_dict`, `_attachments_to_list`) so every code path returning attachment metadata benefits. The internal download path in `get_redmine_attachment` deliberately uses the raw URL — that call goes server-to-Redmine and must stay on the internal hostname. When `REDMINE_PUBLIC_URL` is unset (the default), the raw URL is returned and callers can fall back to `get_redmine_attachment` for a sandbox-safe download URL via the MCP server's proxy ([#110](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/110)).
- **`manage_*` tools: `action` is now a JSON-schema enum** instead of a free-form string. The 10 `manage_X` tools (`manage_contact`, `manage_issue_category`, `manage_issue_note`, `manage_issue_relation`, `manage_issue_watcher`, `manage_product`, `manage_project_member`, `manage_redmine_version`, `manage_redmine_wiki_page`, `manage_time_entry`) declare `action` as a `Literal[...]` so strict MCP clients can validate the value, permissive clients get autocomplete, and invalid actions are rejected at the FastMCP boundary (with the standardized `INVALID_ARGUMENTS` envelope from #108) rather than reaching the dispatch decorator. A schema regression test pins each tool's allowed action set so drift between the dispatch spec and the public signature breaks loudly ([#112](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/112)).
- **`list_redmine_issues`**: `status_id` now accepts Redmine's documented sentinel strings (`"open"`, `"closed"`, `"*"`) in addition to a numeric status ID. Previously, passing `status_id="open"` (the first thing many LLM callers reach for, and the shape Redmine's REST API itself accepts) failed with a raw Pydantic int-parsing error; callers had to discover the `filters={"status_id": "open"}` escape hatch. The widened type (`int | Literal["open", "closed", "*"]`) is reflected in the tool's JSON schema, so strict MCP clients also see the new accepted values ([#107](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/107)).
- **Pydantic-validation-error boundary middleware**: a new FastMCP middleware (`CleanValidationErrorMiddleware`) intercepts argument-validation `pydantic.ValidationError`s raised before the tool body runs and returns the project's standard envelope (`{"error", "hint", "code": "INVALID_ARGUMENTS", additional_errors?}`) as both text and `structured_content`. Previously, the raw Pydantic v2 dump (including `errors.pydantic.dev` URLs) leaked through to the MCP caller, which was verbose and not actionable inside an LLM loop. The middleware honors FastMCP's `x-fastmcp-wrap-result` output-schema convention (tools returning `Union[List, Dict]`, etc.), so the envelope reaches strict clients intact instead of tripping a misleading "Output validation error: 'result' is a required property" on the client side. Union/Literal mismatches collapse all branch complaints into a single `error` message ("expected int or one of 'open','closed','*'"). Missing-required-argument errors name the parameter explicitly instead of echoing the whole args dict ([#108](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/108)).

### Fixed
- **`get_redmine_attachment`**: when Redmine's `GET /attachments/{id}.json` returns 404, the tool now returns a structured envelope (`code: ATTACHMENT_UNAVAILABLE`, `upstream_status: 404`, plus a `hint`) instead of a bare `"Attachment N not found."` message. Redmine collapses three distinct conditions into the same 404 (genuine deletion, lack of view permission on the container, and orphan metadata whose underlying file is unreadable on the server's disk); callers that see the attachment via `get_redmine_issue(include_attachments=True)` but get 404 here are usually hitting one of the last two. The new hint surfaces those causes and points to the embed path as the workaround so LLM callers can recover without a second wrong-tool round-trip ([#106](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/106)).
- **`search_redmine_issues`**: previously returned `null` for `subject`, `status`, `priority`, `project`, `assigned_to`, `author`, `created_on`, and `updated_on` regardless of what `fields` requested, because Redmine's `/search.json` endpoint only populates `id` and a description snippet. The tool now transparently hydrates each search hit via `/issues.json` (with `status_id="*"` so closed matches still hydrate), preserving search relevance order and falling back per-issue to the sparse search result for any id missing from the hydration response (e.g., deleted between calls). Hydration is skipped when `fields` only requests `id` and/or `description`, so the lightweight one-call path is still available. Hydration failures are logged and degrade gracefully to the previous sparse behavior rather than raising. Large id sets are batched at 100 ids per `/issues.json` call to stay within typical URL-length limits.

### Security
- Pin all GitHub Actions to immutable commit SHAs across all workflows to prevent supply chain attacks via tag hijacking (`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-python`, `astral-sh/setup-uv`, `actions/github-script`, `codecov/codecov-action`). Version tags are preserved as inline comments.
- Bump `fastmcp` from 3.2.0 to 3.2.4, patching three security issues: FileUpload now validates actual decoded base64 size instead of trusting client-reported size; proxy client no longer forwards inbound HTTP headers to unrelated remote servers; AuthKit auto-binds token audience to resource URL per RFC 8707, closing a token-reuse gap.
- Bump `pytest` from 9.0.2 to 9.0.3, patching CVE-2025-71176 (insecure temporary directory usage).
- Bump `python-multipart` from 0.0.26 to 0.0.27, patching CVE-2026-42561; added explicit lower-bound constraint to prevent silent regression to vulnerable versions.

### CI
- Bump `astral-sh/setup-uv` from v4 to v7 (node24, faster version resolution for `>=` specifiers)
- Bump `actions/github-script` from v8 to v9
- Bump `codecov/codecov-action` from v5 to v6

### Added
- **`get_redmine_attachment`**: unified attachment retrieval tool that works in both HTTP and stdio deployments
  - Downloads the attachment to local disk and returns an HTTP URI (`uri_type: "http"`) when `PUBLIC_HOST` (or `SERVER_HOST`) resolves to an external hostname, or an absolute local `file_path` (`uri_type: "file"`) in stdio mode -- the model does not need to know which mode is active
  - Streaming download with configurable byte-cap abort (`ATTACHMENT_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES`, default 200 MB); partial files are deleted on abort
  - Atomic temp-file rename pattern (`{filename}.tmp` -> final) consistent with existing file tools
  - All stored files go through the existing `AttachmentFileManager` expiry and cleanup cycle
  - `filename` in the response is wrapped in `<insecure-content>` boundary tags (attacker-controlled)
  - Path traversal protection: filename sanitized to basename before writing to disk
  - Host resolution follows the same fallback chain as the existing tool: `PUBLIC_HOST` -> `SERVER_HOST` -> `localhost`; port resolved via `PUBLIC_PORT` -> `SERVER_PORT` -> `8000`
- **`ATTACHMENT_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES`** environment variable (default `209715200`, 200 MB): cap applied to all `get_redmine_attachment` downloads regardless of content type
- **`_get_int_env(var, default)`** helper in `_env.py` for numeric environment variables (all existing helpers are boolean `_is_*` functions)
- **10 new unit tests** covering HTTP mode, stdio mode, `SERVER_HOST` fallback, absolute `file_path`, filename injection wrapping, byte-cap abort, metadata.json cleanup registration, path traversal sanitization, cap-abort leaving no partial files, and 404 error handling

### Removed
- **`get_redmine_attachment_download_url`**: removed in this major version. Use `get_redmine_attachment` instead, which works in both HTTP and stdio deployments.

### Changed
- Consolidated 35 MCP tools into 9 `manage_X` tools, reducing total tool count from 69 to 43:
  - `add_project_member`, `update_project_member`, `remove_project_member` -> `manage_project_member(action=...)`
  - `list_issue_categories`, `create_issue_category`, `update_issue_category`, `delete_issue_category` -> `manage_issue_category(action=...)`
  - `list_issue_relations`, `create_issue_relation`, `delete_issue_relation` -> `manage_issue_relation(action=...)`
  - `add_watcher`, `remove_watcher` -> `manage_issue_watcher(action=...)`
  - `edit_note`, `set_note_private` -> `manage_issue_note(action=...)` (`get_private_notes` kept standalone)
  - `create_time_entry`, `update_time_entry`, `log_time_for_user` -> `manage_time_entry(action=...)`
  - `get_redmine_wiki_page`, `create_redmine_wiki_page`, `update_redmine_wiki_page`, `delete_redmine_wiki_page`, `list_wiki_pages`, `rename_wiki_page` -> `manage_redmine_wiki_page(action=...)`
  - `list_products`, `get_product`, `add_product`, `edit_product` -> `manage_product(action=...)` (still gated by `REDMINE_PRODUCTS_ENABLED=true`)
  - `list_contacts`, `get_contact`, `create_contact`, `edit_contact`, `delete_contact`, `assign_contact_to_project`, `remove_contact_from_project` -> `manage_contact(action=...)` (still gated by `REDMINE_CRM_ENABLED=true`)
  - `mark_checklist_done` removed: use `update_checklist_item(is_done=True)` directly
- `manage_time_entry(action="create", user_id=...)` replaces `log_time_for_user`
- Verb normalization: `add_product` / `edit_product` map to `manage_product(action="create"|"update")`; `create_contact` / `edit_contact` map to `manage_contact(action="create"|"update")` to match the dominant CRUD pattern in the codebase
- Response shape change: callers of `mark_checklist_done` previously received `{"is_done": bool}`; the equivalent `update_checklist_item` call returns `{"updated_fields": ["is_done"]}`
- Read-only mode: write actions within `manage_X` tools are blocked; read actions (`list`, `get`) remain available
- Refactored `redmine_handler.py` (6591 lines) into a `tools/` package and focused private modules. The 43 MCP tools now live in 11 per-resource files under `src/redmine_mcp_server/tools/`, with shared helpers in flat `_X.py` modules (`_client.py`, `_errors.py`, `_validation.py`, `_serialization.py`, `_env.py`, `_custom_fields.py`, `_ssrf.py`, `_cleanup.py`, `_http_routes.py`). Public MCP surface is unchanged (same 43 tools, parameters, return shapes, read-only behavior). **Breaking for any consumer importing from internal paths**: external code using `from redmine_mcp_server.redmine_handler import ...` must migrate to the new module paths (e.g., `from redmine_mcp_server.tools.projects import manage_project_member`, `from redmine_mcp_server._validation import _is_positive_int`). The `redmine_handler` module is removed in v2.0.0.
- Codified the `manage_X(action=...)` pattern via a new `@action_dispatch` decorator in `_decorators.py`. The 9 `manage_X` tools (plus `manage_redmine_version`) now declare their action set as `{action: ActionMode.READ|WRITE}` and the decorator handles validation, read-only guards, and cleanup-task initialization. Future `manage_X` tools should use this decorator for consistency.

### Contributors

  - **`mark_checklist_done`**: convenience tool to toggle done/undone state of a checklist item
- `REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED=true` opt-in support for RedmineUP Agile plugin: `get_redmine_issue` auto-includes `story_points`, `agile_sprint_id`, and `agile_position`; `update_redmine_issue` accepts `story_points` in the `fields` dict
- **14 new MCP tools for Issue Tracking:**
  - **Copying and hierarchy:**
    - `copy_issue` — duplicate an existing issue via Redmine's native `copy_from` mechanism, with optional field overrides and support for copying subtasks/attachments
    - `list_subtasks` — list child issues of a given parent (subtasks are created via existing `create_redmine_issue` with `parent_issue_id`)
  - **Issue relations (blocks, duplicates, precedes, etc.):**
    - `list_issue_relations` — list all relations for an issue
    - `create_issue_relation` — create a relation between two issues; validates `relation_type` against Redmine's taxonomy
    - `delete_issue_relation` — delete a relation by ID
  - **Watchers:**
    - `add_watcher` — add a user to an issue's watcher list (Redmine 2.3.0+)
    - `remove_watcher` — remove a user from an issue's watcher list
  - **Journal/note management:**
    - `edit_note` — update an existing journal note's text and/or `private_notes` flag via `PUT /journals/{id}.json`
    - `get_private_notes` — retrieve only the private notes on an issue (requires "View private notes" permission)

    - `delete_issue_category` — delete a category with optional `reassign_to_id` to move existing issues
- **55 new unit tests** covering all new tools (read-only mode enforcement, success paths, error paths, helper conversions)
- **5 new MCP tools for Projects:**
  - `list_redmine_roles` — list all roles defined in the Redmine instance; use before `add_project_member`/`update_project_member` to discover valid `role_ids` (role IDs vary between Redmine instances)
  - `get_project_modules` — retrieve enabled modules for a project via `?include=enabled_modules`
  - `add_project_member` — add a user or group to a project with assigned roles; validates that exactly one of `user_id` or `group_id` is provided
  - `update_project_member` — update the roles of an existing membership
  - `remove_project_member` — remove a membership (inherited memberships from parent projects surface as a 422 validation error)
- `role_ids` validation errors in `add_project_member` / `update_project_member` now hint at `list_redmine_roles` to prevent AI agents from hallucinating role IDs
- **33 new unit tests** for project tools covering modules retrieval (including dict-format fallback for older Redmine versions), role discovery, membership CRUD, validation errors, read-only mode enforcement, error paths, and error-message discoverability hints
- **2 new MCP tools for Time Tracking:**
  - `log_time_for_user` — create a time entry on behalf of another user via the `user_id` parameter on `POST /time_entries.json`; requires `log_time_for_other_users` permission on the target project
  - `import_time_entries` — bulk import multiple time entries via sequential API calls (Redmine has no native bulk endpoint); accepts a list of dicts or JSON array string, captures per-entry errors, and returns `{total, succeeded, failed, created, errors}` so partial imports still yield useful feedback; supports `stop_on_error` flag
- Add missing `REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY` enforcement to existing `create_time_entry` tool
- **23 new unit tests** for time tracking tools covering success paths, per-entry validation (missing hours, negative hours, missing target), JSON string input, partial failure handling, `stop_on_error`, field whitelisting, read-only mode, and Redmine-version permission quirks
- **3 new MCP tools for Files:**
  - `list_files` — list files uploaded to a project's Files section (core Redmine "Files" module, distinct from issue attachments and DMSF documents); returns filename, filesize, content type, description, download URL, author, optional version/release
  - `upload_file` — upload a new file via Redmine's two-step upload (`POST /uploads.json` for token, then `POST /projects/{id}/files.json`). Accepts either `source_url` (HTTP/HTTPS URL the server downloads from) or `content_base64` (raw bytes encoded as base64); the URL path enables chaining with other MCP tools that return download URLs (e.g., Google Drive MCP). Streaming download with 30s timeout, follows redirects, infers filename from URL path or `Content-Disposition` header. 50 MiB size cap
  - `delete_file` — delete a project file via `DELETE /attachments/{id}.json`
- **36 new unit tests** for file tools covering base64 encoding/decoding, URL-based download (success, invalid schemes, HTTP errors, timeouts, empty body, Content-Disposition filename fallback), size limits, read-only mode, missing/conflicting content sources, and Redmine error paths
- **6 new MCP Discovery / Enumeration tools** to help LLMs find valid IDs without guessing:
  - `list_redmine_trackers` — list all trackers (issue types like Bug, Feature, Support) for discovering valid `tracker_id` values
  - `list_redmine_issue_statuses` — list all issue statuses with their `is_closed` flag for discovering valid `status_id` values
  - `list_redmine_issue_priorities` — list all priority levels via `enumeration.filter(resource="issue_priorities")`
  - `list_redmine_users` — filter/list users with optional `name` and `group_id` filters (admin-only, limit clamped to 1-100)
  - `get_current_user` — retrieve the authenticated user's profile via `GET /my/account.json` (works for non-admins; useful when a user says "do X for me")
  - `list_redmine_queries` — list all saved custom queries visible to the current user (read-only; Redmine's API does not support CRUD on queries)
- **20 new unit tests** for discovery tools covering success paths, empty results, limit clamping, filter parameters, and permission-denied error paths

### Security
- **SSRF protection for `upload_file(source_url=...)`:** The server now resolves every URL hop and rejects non-public destinations (loopback, RFC1918, link-local including cloud metadata services like `169.254.169.254`, reserved, multicast). Redirects are followed manually with per-hop revalidation to defeat public-to-private 302 bypasses. Capped at 5 redirect hops. URLs with embedded credentials (`http://user:pass@host`) are refused up front to prevent credential leakage across redirects. SSRF error messages no longer include the resolved IP (logged at WARNING level instead) to avoid leaking internal network topology. Opt-in dev override: `REDMINE_ALLOW_PRIVATE_FETCH_URLS=true`. (Note: DNS rebinding between our check and httpx's connect is a theoretical residual risk; IP pinning was evaluated but broke TLS SNI for real CDNs.)
- **`delete_file` is now fail-closed on ambiguous `container_type`:** Previously, if Redmine (or an older python-redmine version) returned `None` or an empty string for `container_type`, the project-scope guard was skipped and the attachment was deleted. Now any non-`"Project"` value refuses the delete, with an explicit `confirm_delete_any_attachment=True` flag for bypass.
- **Int-ID validators reject booleans and non-positive values:** Python treats `True`/`False` as `int`, so `role_ids=[True]` would silently assign role ID 1 (often an elevated role). New `_is_positive_int` helper is applied to `role_ids`, `user_id`, and `group_id` parameters in `add_project_member`, `update_project_member`, `add_watcher`, `remove_watcher`, and `log_time_for_user`.
- **Attacker-controlled display names wrapped:** New `_named_ref()` helper wraps `user.name`, `author.name`, and `version.name` fields (all user-controlled) in `<insecure-content>` boundary tags. Applied via `_named_ref` to `_file_to_dict` and `_attachments_to_list` (previously, attachment filenames/descriptions were only wrapped in the new `list_files` output but NOT in `get_redmine_issue(include_attachments=True)` -- now consistent across both).
- **Prompt-injection hardening:** `filename`, `description`, and time-entry `comments` returned from `list_files`/`upload_file`/`log_time_for_user`/`import_time_entries` are now wrapped in `<insecure-content>` boundary tags (matching existing issue/journal/description handling). Prevents attacker-controllable Redmine metadata from being treated as trusted instructions by downstream LLMs.
- **Error-message secret scrubbing:** `_handle_redmine_error` now redacts API keys (`?key=`, `X-Redmine-API-Key`), Bearer tokens, HTTP basic-auth credentials, and the configured `REDMINE_API_KEY` before returning errors to MCP callers. Logs still see the raw message.
- **Content-Disposition filename sanitization:** URL-inferred and header-derived filenames are URL-decoded, stripped of path components (defeats `../../../etc/passwd` traversal on both POSIX and Windows), rejected if they contain null bytes or control characters, and capped at 255 chars.
- **`delete_file` container-type check:** Since Redmine's `DELETE /attachments/{id}.json` removes any attachment by ID (including issue/wiki attachments), `delete_file` now verifies the target is a project file before deleting. Callers can bypass with `confirm_delete_any_attachment=True`.
- Bump `cryptography` from 46.0.6 to 46.0.7, patching CVE-2026-39892 (out-of-bounds read via non-contiguous buffers)

### Fixed
- **`_is_valid_project_id` URL-path safety:** Restricts string identifiers to Redmine's documented charset (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,99}$`), rejecting `/`, `?`, `#`, `..`, whitespace, and uppercase before they can be interpolated into URL paths in the new Wiki/Products/CRM tools.
- **`add_product` `status_id` constraint:** Now rejects values other than `1` (Active) or `2` (Inactive) instead of forwarding arbitrary positive integers to the API.
- **`copy_issue` data-integrity bug:** When both `copy_subtasks=False` and `copy_attachments=False` were passed, python-redmine's `include or (...)` fallback silently copied both anyway. Now passes a non-empty sentinel so the fallback does not trigger.
- **`log_time_for_user` / `import_time_entries` hours validation:** Now rejects NaN, Infinity, booleans (which Python treats as `int`), and non-numeric types before hitting the API.
- **`import_time_entries` bulk safeguards:** Added a 500-entry batch cap (returns a clear error instead of pinning the event loop for minutes on a massive request). Yields the event loop between entries via `asyncio.sleep(0)` so concurrent MCP requests are not starved. Split the create/serialize try blocks so a post-create serialization failure does not flip a successful create into a reported failure (which would tempt callers to retry and create duplicates).

### Changed
- **`get_gantt_chart` default `include_closed` is now `False`.** Pass `include_closed=True` to retain prior behavior. Keeps response size and pagination cost low on long-lived projects.
- **List tools now return `Union[List, Dict]` on error** instead of `[{"error": "..."}]`. Affects `list_issue_relations`, `list_subtasks`, `list_issue_categories`, `list_files`, `list_redmine_roles`, `list_redmine_trackers`, `list_redmine_issue_statuses`, `list_redmine_issue_priorities`, `list_redmine_users`, `list_redmine_queries`. Callers should check `isinstance(result, dict)` or `"error" in result` to distinguish failure from an empty list. Matches the pre-existing convention of `list_time_entries`, `list_redmine_issues`, and `search_redmine_issues`.
- **List tools now cap results at 500 items** (configurable via `_DEFAULT_LIST_RESULT_CAP` constant) via the new `_iter_capped` helper. Previously unbounded iteration could OOM on projects with tens of thousands of subtasks/relations/files.
- **Module-level constants consolidated:** `_FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_BYTES`, `_MAX_FILENAME_LEN`, `_IMPORT_TIME_ENTRIES_MAX_BATCH`, `_DEFAULT_LIST_RESULT_CAP`, `_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT`, and `_FILE_DOWNLOAD_MAX_REDIRECTS` are all declared once at the top of the module instead of scattered across different sections. Top-level `import httpx` and `from urllib.parse import unquote, urlparse` hoisted out of function-local imports.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-14
### Added
- `REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED=true` opt-in support for RedmineUP Agile plugin: `get_redmine_issue` auto-includes `story_points`, `agile_sprint_id`, and `agile_position`; `update_redmine_issue` accepts `story_points` in the `fields` dict

- Patch 14 CVEs across 7 transitive dependencies: pyjwt 2.12.1 (CVE-2026-32597), cryptography 46.0.6 (CVE-2026-26007, CVE-2026-34073), starlette 1.0.0 / fastapi 0.135.2 (CVE-2025-54121, CVE-2025-62727), urllib3 2.6.3 (CVE-2025-50181/82, CVE-2025-66418/71, CVE-2026-21441), requests 2.33.1 (CVE-2024-47081, CVE-2026-25645), python-multipart 0.0.22 (CVE-2026-24486), pygments 2.20.0 (CVE-2026-4539)

### CI
- Add `dependency-audit.yml` workflow: lockfile integrity check (`uv lock --check`), CVE scanning via `pip-audit`, and PR step summary flagging lockfile changes for supply-chain review
- Pin upper bounds on all runtime and dev dependencies in `pyproject.toml` to prevent unexpected major-version upgrades
- Upgrade CI workflows to `actions/checkout@v6` and `actions/setup-python@v6`
- Replace manual venv activation with `astral-sh/setup-uv@v4` and `uv sync --locked` for reproducible installs
- Use `uv run` for all tool invocations (`flake8`, `black`, `pytest`) instead of sourcing `.venv`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-21
### Fixed
- Version and auth mode are now logged at module import time, ensuring they appear in Docker deployments where the server is started via `uvicorn main:app` directly (bypassing `main()`)
- Pass `log_config=None` to `uvicorn.run()` to preserve the configured logging format in local deployments

### Changed
- Migrated from `mcp[cli]>=1.25.0,<2` to `fastmcp>=3.0.0,<4` (standalone FastMCP v3 package)

### Dependencies
- Bump `uvicorn` from 0.40.0 to 0.42.0
- Bump `black` from 26.1.0 to 26.3.1
- Bump `python-dotenv` from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2
- Updated import from `mcp.server.fastmcp` to `fastmcp`
- Replaced `mcp.streamable_http_app()` with `mcp.http_app(stateless_http=True)` (v3 API)
- Removed `mcp.settings.stateless_http` runtime mutation (`stateless_http` is now passed to `http_app()`)
- Removed `host=` parameter from `FastMCP()` constructor (not a valid v3 parameter; DNS rebinding protection removed from FastMCP v3 entirely -- no behaviour change for Docker deployments)
- Converted `list_redmine_issues` and `search_redmine_issues` from `**kwargs` to explicit parameters (FastMCP v3 no longer supports `**kwargs` tool functions); additional arbitrary filters still available via `filters={}` / `options={}` dict parameters

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-14
### Added
- **New MCP Tool: `list_project_members`** - List members and groups of a Redmine project
  - Returns user/group info along with assigned roles
  - Supports both numeric project IDs and string identifiers
- **New MCP Tools: Time Tracking** - Full time entry management
  - `list_time_entries` - List time entries with filtering by project, issue, user, and date range
  - `create_time_entry` - Log time against projects or issues with activity and date support
  - `update_time_entry` - Modify existing time entries (hours, comments, activity, date)
  - `list_time_entry_activities` - Discover available activity types (Development, Design, etc.) for time entry creation
  - All tools support pagination and use `_get_redmine_client()` for OAuth compatibility
- **50 new unit tests** for project members and time tracking tools (`test_project_members.py`, `test_time_entries.py`)
- **26 new integration tests** covering all 21 MCP tools with zero skips -- includes project members (4), time entries (7), custom fields (3), search issues (3), summarize project (3), global search (4), and cleanup (2)
- **OAuth2 per-user authentication mode** (`REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth`)
  - New `oauth_middleware.py`: Starlette middleware that validates `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers against Redmine's `/users/current.json` before forwarding MCP requests
  - Per-request token isolation via `contextvars.ContextVar` -- safe under async concurrent load
  - `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` endpoint (RFC 8707) -- points MCP clients to the authorization server
  - `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` endpoint (RFC 8414) -- advertises Redmine's Doorkeeper OAuth endpoints (`/oauth/authorize`, `/oauth/token`, `/oauth/revoke`) since Redmine does not serve this document itself
  - `POST /revoke` endpoint (RFC 7009) -- proxies token revocation to Redmine's `/oauth/revoke`, enabling proper disconnect flow from MCP clients
  - PKCE (`S256`) and both `client_secret_post` / `client_secret_basic` token endpoint auth methods advertised
  - Requires Redmine 6.1+ (Doorkeeper OAuth2 support)
- **`REDMINE_AUTH_MODE` environment variable** -- selects `legacy` (default) or `oauth` mode; legacy mode is unchanged so existing deployments require no changes
- **`REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL` environment variable** -- public base URL of this server, used in OAuth discovery documents (only required in oauth mode)
- **`_get_redmine_client()` factory function** in `redmine_handler.py` -- creates a per-request Redmine client using OAuth token -> API key -> username/password priority; replaces the module-level shared client
- **33 new unit tests** for OAuth middleware, discovery endpoints, token revocation, and auth selection logic (`tests/test_oauth_middleware.py`)
- **Prompt Injection Protection** - User-controlled content from Redmine is now wrapped in unique boundary tags to prevent prompt injection attacks against LLM consumers
  - New `wrap_insecure_content()` function wraps non-empty strings in `<insecure-content-{boundary}>` tags with a random 16-character hex boundary per call
  - Applied to 6 helper functions: `_issue_to_dict` (description), `_issue_to_dict_selective` (description), `_journals_to_list` (notes), `_resource_to_dict` (excerpt), `_wiki_page_to_dict` (text), `_version_to_dict` (description)
  - 22 new tests in `test_prompt_injection.py`
- **Read-Only Mode** - Block all write operations via `REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY=true` environment variable
  - Guards 5 write tools: `create_redmine_issue`, `update_redmine_issue`, `create_redmine_wiki_page`, `update_redmine_wiki_page`, `delete_redmine_wiki_page`
  - Read tools (`get_redmine_issue`, `list_redmine_projects`, `list_redmine_issues`, etc.) remain fully functional
  - Local operations (`cleanup_attachment_files`) are not restricted
  - 15 new tests in `test_read_only_mode.py`
  - Updated `.env.example` and `.env.docker` with `REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY` variable
- **Journal Pagination on `get_redmine_issue`** - New `journal_limit` and `journal_offset` parameters for paginating through issue journals
  - When `journal_limit` is set, response includes `journal_pagination` metadata (`total`, `offset`, `limit`, `count`, `has_more`)
  - Default behavior unchanged (returns all journals without pagination metadata)
  - 9 new tests covering limit, offset, combined pagination, edge cases, and backward compatibility
- **Include Flags on `get_redmine_issue`** - Three new boolean parameters for fetching additional issue data
  - `include_watchers` (default: `false`) - Returns watcher list with `id` and `name`
  - `include_relations` (default: `false`) - Returns issue relations with `id`, `issue_id`, `issue_to_id`, `relation_type`
  - `include_children` (default: `false`) - Returns child issues with `id`, `subject`, `tracker`
  - All flags default to `false` for backward compatibility
  - Include parameters are passed to the Redmine API for server-side inclusion
  - 11 new tests covering all flags, combinations, missing attributes, and structure validation

### Breaking
- **Removed `list_my_redmine_issues`** - Deprecated since v0.11.0. Use `list_redmine_issues(assigned_to_id='me')` instead.
  - All references in docstrings updated to point to `list_redmine_issues()`

### Fixed
- **Custom routes (well-known endpoints) not served at runtime** -- `mcp.run()` created a fresh internal app discarding route registrations; switched to `uvicorn.run(app, ...)` so the decorated app instance is always what serves requests
- **`REDMINE_URL` KeyError at import time** -- `oauth_middleware.py` now uses `os.environ.get()` instead of `os.environ[]`, so the server starts cleanly even if `REDMINE_URL` is not set before import
- **Legacy client recreated on every tool call** -- `_get_redmine_client()` now caches a singleton `_legacy_client` in legacy mode instead of building a new `Redmine()` instance per request
- **OAuth routes exposed in legacy mode** -- well-known endpoints and `/revoke` are now only registered when `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth`

### Changed
- `main()` now runs via `uvicorn.run(app, ...)` directly instead of `mcp.run(transport="streamable-http")` to ensure custom route registrations are preserved

### Improved
- **Code Quality** - Added `.flake8` config for Black compatibility (E203 ignore)

### Contributors
- @mihajlovicjj -- OAuth2 per-user authentication, `/revoke` endpoint, discovery endpoints, and 33 new tests ([#71](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/71))
- @mihajlovicjj -- Project members and time tracking tools with 50 new tests ([#72](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/72))

## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **421 Misdirected Request in Docker/public deployments** ([#69](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/69))
  - Pass `SERVER_HOST` to FastMCP so DNS rebinding protection is configured correctly
  - When host is `0.0.0.0` (Docker/public), FastMCP skips auto-enabling DNS rebinding protection, avoiding 421 errors for connections via public IPs

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **New MCP Tool: `list_project_issue_custom_fields`** - Discover issue custom fields for a Redmine project
  - Lists custom field metadata (`id`, `name`, `field_format`, `is_required`, `multiple`, `default_value`)
  - Includes allowed values (`possible_values`) and tracker bindings (`trackers`)
  - Optional `tracker_id` filter to show only fields applicable to a specific tracker
  - 7 unit tests covering serialization, filtering, validation, and error handling
- **New MCP Tool: `list_redmine_versions`** - List versions/milestones for a Redmine project
  - Filter by `project_id` (numeric or string identifier)
  - Optional `status_filter` parameter (open, locked, closed)
  - Client-side filtering with input validation
  - 18 unit tests covering helper, basic functionality, filtering, and error handling
  - 6 integration tests for project ID, string identifier, structure, filtering, and error handling
- **`fixed_version_id` filter** documented for `list_redmine_issues` tool
- **Claude Desktop MCP client configuration** added to README with stdio transport via FastMCP proxy
- `get_redmine_issue` now supports `include_custom_fields` (default: `true`) and can return serialized issue `custom_fields`.
- `update_redmine_issue` now supports updating custom fields by name (for example `{"size": "S"}`) by resolving project custom-field metadata.

### Fixed
- **Required custom field handling** for `create_redmine_issue` and `update_redmine_issue` ([#65](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/65))
  - Auto-retry on validation errors for missing required custom fields (e.g., "cannot be blank", "is not included in the list")
  - Fills values from Redmine custom field `default_value` or `REDMINE_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELD_DEFAULTS` env var
  - Opt-in via `REDMINE_AUTOFILL_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELDS=true` environment variable
  - `create_redmine_issue` now accepts `fields` as a JSON object string for flexible custom field payloads
  - Added `REDMINE_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELD_DEFAULTS` env var for specifying fallback values per field name
  - Updated `.env.example` and `.env.docker` with new environment variables

### Breaking
- **`create_redmine_issue` `extra_fields` parameter** -- Previously, passing `extra_fields` as a plain string would forward it directly to Redmine as an attribute. Now it is parsed as a JSON object (or dict) and merged into the issue payload. Callers who relied on the old behaviour of sending a raw `extra_fields` string attribute should migrate to `fields` or provide a JSON object string instead.

### Changed
- **Dependency Updates**
  - `black` upgraded from 25.12.0 to 26.1.0
- Improved issue update validation for named custom fields with clear errors when values are not allowed for the target custom field.

### Contributors
- @sebastianelsner -- custom field discovery tool, required custom field handling, and custom field update support ([#65](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/65), [#66](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/pull/66))

### Improved
- **Test Coverage** - 44 new unit tests for custom field helper functions (`redmine_handler.py` lines 474-640)
  - Covers `_is_true_env`, `_normalize_field_label`, `_parse_create_issue_fields`, `_extract_possible_values`, `_extract_missing_required_field_names`, `_load_required_custom_field_defaults`, `_is_missing_custom_field_value`, `_is_allowed_custom_field_value`, `_resolve_required_custom_field_value`
  - `redmine_handler.py` coverage improved from 94% to 97% (with integration tests)
  - Overall coverage improved from 95% to 98%
- **Documentation** - Updated README and tool-reference.md
  - Tool count updated from 15 to 17

## [0.7.1] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed
- **Critical: Redmine client initialization failure when installed via pip** ([#40](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/40))
  - `.env` file is now loaded from the current working directory first, then falls back to package directory
  - Previously, the server only looked for `.env` relative to the installed package location (site-packages), causing "Redmine client not initialized" errors for pip-installed users
  - Added helpful warning messages when `REDMINE_URL` or authentication credentials are missing
  - Removed redundant `load_dotenv()` call from `main.py` to avoid duplicate initialization

### Added
- **Regression Tests** - Added 8 new tests in `test_env_loading.py` to prevent future regressions:
  - Tests for `.env` loading from current working directory
  - Tests for warning messages when configuration is missing
  - Tests for CWD precedence over package directory

### Migration Notes
- **No Breaking Changes** - Existing configurations continue to work
- **Recommended** - Place your `.env` file in the directory where you run the server (current working directory)
- **Fallback** - If no `.env` found in CWD, the package directory is checked as before

## [0.7.0] - 2025-11-29

### Added
- **Search Optimization** - Comprehensive enhancements to `search_redmine_issues()` to prevent MCP token overflow
  - **Pagination Support** - Server-side pagination with `limit` (default: 25, max: 1000) and `offset` parameters

  - **Native Search Filters** - Support for Redmine Search API native filters:
    - `scope` parameter (values: "all", "my_project", "subprojects")
    - `open_issues` parameter for filtering open issues only
  - **Pagination Metadata** - Optional structured response with `include_pagination_info` parameter
  - **Helper Function** - Added `_issue_to_dict_selective()` for efficient field filtering

### Changed
- **Default Behavior** - `search_redmine_issues()` now returns max 25 issues by default (was unlimited)
  - Prevents MCP token overflow (25,000 token limit)
  - Use `limit` parameter to customize page size
  - Fully backward compatible for existing usage patterns

### Improved
- **Performance** - Significant improvements for search operations:
  - Memory efficient: Uses server-side pagination
  - Token efficient: Default limit keeps responses under 2,000 tokens
  - ~95% token reduction possible with minimal field selection
  - ~87% faster response times for large result sets
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive updates:
  - Updated `docs/tool-reference.md` with detailed search parameters and examples

- `download_redmine_attachment()` - Use `get_redmine_attachment_download_url()` instead
  - SECURITY: `save_dir` parameter vulnerable to path traversal (CWE-22, CVSS 7.5)
  - Will be removed in v0.5.0

### Security
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed path traversal vulnerability in attachment downloads (CVSS 7.5)

## [0.3.1] - 2025-09-21

### Fixed
- Integration test compatibility with new attachment download API format

## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-21

### Added
- **Automatic file cleanup system** with configurable intervals and expiry times
- `AUTO_CLEANUP_ENABLED` environment variable for enabling/disabling automatic cleanup (default: true)
- `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES` environment variable for cleanup frequency (default: 10 minutes)
- `ATTACHMENT_EXPIRES_MINUTES` environment variable for default attachment expiry (default: 60 minutes)
- Background cleanup task with lazy initialization via MCP tool calls

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_HOURS` replaced with `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES` for finer control

## [0.2.1] - 2025-09-20

### Added
- HTTP file serving endpoint (`/files/{file_id}`) for downloaded attachments
- Secure UUID-based file URLs with automatic expiry (24 hours default)

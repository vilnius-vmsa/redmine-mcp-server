# OAuth2 Multi-Tenant Setup Guide

Set up the MCP server so each user authenticates with their own Redmine account.

**Requirements:** Redmine 6.1+ and admin access to register an OAuth application.

> **No OAuth on your Redmine?** Easy Redmine and Redmine older than 6.1 have no Doorkeeper. Use `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=api-key-login` instead: clients connect the same way, and each user logs in once with their own API key. See the [api-key-login guide](api-key-login-auth.md).

This guide covers both direct Redmine Bearer-token mode (`REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth`) and hosted OAuthProxy mode (`REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth-proxy`). In `oauth-proxy` mode, FastMCP handles DCR/CIMD for MCP clients and uses Redmine as the upstream OAuth provider and external consent screen.

## Step 1: Register an OAuth App in Redmine

1. Log in as admin → **Administration → Applications** → **New Application**
2. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `MCP Server`
   - **Redirect URI:** `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/callback` for direct OAuth mode, or `${REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL}/auth/callback` for OAuthProxy mode
   - **Confidential:** Yes
3. Save and note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

## Step 2: Register a Doorkeeper Introspection Client

The MCP server validates incoming Bearer tokens by calling Doorkeeper's RFC 7662 introspection endpoint (`POST /oauth/introspect`). To do this it needs a confidential OAuth application registered in Redmine. In `oauth-proxy` mode this can be the same app from Step 1; a separate app is only useful for independent credential rotation or clearer audit labels.

### 2a. Register the application

1. **Sign in to Redmine as administrator → Administration → Applications → New Application.**
2. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `Redmine MCP Server (introspection)`
   - **Redirect URI:** `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` (this client never performs the authorization-code dance; the URI is unused but required by the form)
   - **Confidential:** Yes
   - **Scopes:** leave empty
3. Save and note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

> **If the Administration → Applications page returns 403:** Redmine's `admin_authenticator` for Doorkeeper requires REST API to be enabled. Go to **Administration → Settings → API → "Enable REST web service"** and save. (You can also flip this from a Rails console: `Setting.rest_api_enabled = "1"`.)

### 2b. Enable cross-app token introspection in Doorkeeper

Redmine ships with `allow_token_introspection false` hard-coded, which means even an authenticated client cannot introspect a token issued to a different OAuth app. The MCP introspection client needs to introspect tokens issued by the **user-flow** OAuth app (Step 1), so the default has to change.

**Edit Redmine's own initializer in place, on the Redmine server:** `config/initializers/30-redmine.rb`. Find the line:

```ruby
    allow_token_introspection false
```

Replace it with:

```ruby
    allow_token_introspection do |_token, authorized_client, _resource_owner|
      !authorized_client.nil? && authorized_client.confidential?
    end
```

This grants introspection rights to any confidential OAuth client. The MCP introspection client is confidential by configuration (Step 2a). Public clients (e.g., browser-based or native apps registered without a secret) are still rejected. Note: if your user-flow OAuth app from Step 1 is also configured as confidential, it would technically also be permitted to introspect — but only the MCP server uses these credentials in practice.

Restart Redmine after the change.

> **⚠️ Why edit `30-redmine.rb` directly instead of creating a separate initializer?**
>
> Redmine wraps its entire Doorkeeper configuration inside a `Rails.application.config.to_prepare do ... end` block. Doorkeeper's `Doorkeeper.configure do ... end` call **rebuilds the entire `Doorkeeper.config` object from scratch each call** — it does not merge with existing settings. If you add a second `Doorkeeper.configure` block in your own initializer, it wipes Redmine's `admin_authenticator`, `resource_owner_authenticator`, `grant_flows`, `enforce_configured_scopes`, base controller, and every other setting Redmine relies on. The most visible symptom is the entire Administration → Applications page returning 403 with the log warning *"Access to admin panel is forbidden due to Doorkeeper.configure.admin_authenticator being unconfigured"*.
>
> The only safe way to override a single Doorkeeper option in a Redmine deployment is to edit the existing `Doorkeeper.configure` block in `30-redmine.rb` in place. Track the change as a deployment patch (e.g., a Dockerfile `RUN sed -i ...` step) so it survives Redmine upgrades.

### 2c. Verify

```bash
curl -X POST $REDMINE_URL/oauth/introspect \
  -u "$REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID:$REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "token=any-test-token&token_type_hint=access_token"
```

Expected response: `200 OK` with body `{"active":false}`. The `false` is correct (the synthetic token isn't real); what matters is that you got `200`, not `401` or `404`.

Common failure modes:
- **`404 Page not found`** — the `/oauth/introspect` route isn't mounted. Confirm step 2b was applied and Redmine was restarted; the route is only mounted when `allow_token_introspection` is something other than `false`.
- **`401 invalid_client`** — the introspection client's `client_id` / `client_secret` are wrong, or the application isn't marked confidential.
- **`200 {"active": false}` for a *known-valid* user-flow bearer** — your `allow_token_introspection` block is returning falsy for the introspecting client. Confirm the introspection client is confidential and that your block matches the example in Step 2b.

## Step 3: Configure the MCP Server

```bash
REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth
REDMINE_URL=https://redmine.example.com
REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL=https://mcp.example.com   # public URL of this server

# Introspection client (from Step 2)
REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID=<UID from Redmine>
REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_SECRET=<Secret from Redmine>
# Or: REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/redmine_introspect_client_secret

# Optional: /health introspection probe cache TTL in seconds (default 30)
# HEALTH_INTROSPECTION_TTL_SECONDS=30
```

For OAuthProxy mode, use `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth-proxy` and add a stable proxy signing key:

```bash
REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth-proxy
REDMINE_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY=<stable-random-secret>
# Or: REDMINE_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/redmine_mcp_jwt_signing_key

# Where OAuthProxy keeps its encrypted state (below FASTMCP_HOME/oauth-proxy/).
# The Docker image already sets this to /app/data/fastmcp, which docker-compose
# mounts as a volume. Set it yourself only for a non-compose deployment, and use
# a host path for a local run, since /app exists only inside the image.
# FASTMCP_HOME=/app/data/fastmcp

# Optional: restrict which client redirect URIs are accepted (see note below).
# Unset = loopback only. "*" = allow any. Or list patterns for hosted clients.
# REDMINE_MCP_ALLOWED_CLIENT_REDIRECT_URIS=https://app.example.com/*

# Optional: use a separate upstream Redmine OAuth app.
# If unset, REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID / _SECRET are reused.
# REDMINE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<UID from Redmine>
# REDMINE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<Secret from Redmine>
# Or: REDMINE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/redmine_oauth_client_secret
```

Set these in `.env` (local) or `.env.docker` (Docker). Legacy credentials are not needed in OAuth mode.

**Client redirect-URI allowlist:** In `oauth-proxy` mode an MCP client registers its own redirect URI via Dynamic Client Registration. By default the server accepts only loopback targets (`http://localhost:*` and `http://127.0.0.1:*`), which fits local MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Codex CLI, `mcp-remote`) while preventing a registered client from pointing the flow at a remote URL. To support a hosted client with a non-loopback redirect URI, set `REDMINE_MCP_ALLOWED_CLIENT_REDIRECT_URIS` to a comma- or space-separated list of glob patterns (for example `https://app.example.com/*`). Set it to `*` to restore the permissive "accept any redirect URI" behaviour. External consent on Redmine and forwarded PKCE remain in effect regardless of this setting.

**Upstream OAuth client:** When `REDMINE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `REDMINE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` are unset, the introspection client (Step 2) is reused as the upstream authorization client. That client therefore needs more than introspection rights: it must have the **authorization code** grant enabled and `${REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL}/auth/callback` registered as a redirect URI, otherwise `/authorize` fails upstream. This is already true if the introspection client is the Step 1 user-flow app; if you registered a separate introspection-only app, either enable the authorization code grant and redirect URI on it or set `REDMINE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `REDMINE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` to a dedicated upstream app.

**Storage and scaling:** OAuthProxy keeps client registrations, in-flight authorization transactions, and upstream-token mappings in an encrypted file store under `FASTMCP_HOME/oauth-proxy/`. This store is **node-local**, so a request that registers on one instance and continues on another will fail. Run `oauth-proxy` mode as a single replica, or with sticky sessions, unless you provide a shared `OAuthProxy` `client_storage` backend. Mounting `FASTMCP_HOME` to a persistent volume addresses durability across restarts but not cross-replica consistency.

**Persisting the store across rebuilds:** the store has to sit on a volume, or every `docker compose up -d --build` discards it and each client has to reauthorize. Nothing errors when this is wrong, so the server logs the resolved directory at startup (`OAuthProxy state directory: ...`) and warns when `FASTMCP_HOME` is unset. Check that line first when sessions disappear after a deploy.

- The image sets `FASTMCP_HOME=/app/data/fastmcp` and `docker-compose.yml` mounts `./data:/app/data`, so the default compose deployment is already durable.
- A `docker run` without an env file inherits the same default, but still needs `-v` on `/app/data` to keep anything.
- The container runs as uid 1000 (`appuser`). An empty named volume inherits ownership from the image directory it covers, so it works as-is. A **bind mount** does not inherit: on Linux the host directory's owner applies, so `./data` must be writable by uid 1000. A volume that already holds root-owned content stays root-owned and the write fails; remove the volume rather than trying to repair it.
- The store directory is keyed by a fingerprint of `REDMINE_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`. Changing that key orphans the existing state just as effectively as losing the volume, which is why the key has to be stable and set explicitly rather than generated per deploy.

**Expired records:** FastMCP's file store stops serving a record when its TTL passes but never deletes the file. The server deletes expired files below `FASTMCP_HOME/oauth-proxy/` itself, every `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default 10) from boot, whatever `AUTO_CLEANUP_ENABLED` says. Client registrations carry no TTL in FastMCP, so they are kept; on a public deployment, rate-limit `POST /register` at the reverse proxy to bound them.

**Startup behavior:** When `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth` is set, the server fails fast at startup if `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID` or `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_SECRET` is missing — better to surface the misconfiguration immediately than to return 401 on every request.

## Step 4: Start and Verify

```bash
# Local
uv run python -m redmine_mcp_server.main

# Docker
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Verify discovery endpoints:
```bash
# RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata (mounted by FastMCP RemoteAuthProvider)
curl http://localhost:8000/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp

# RFC 8414 authorization-server metadata
#   oauth mode: served at the /mcp-suffixed path (issuer is the Redmine URL)
#   oauth-proxy mode: served at the root path (issuer is REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL),
#                     so the /mcp-suffixed URL 404s
curl http://localhost:8000/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/mcp   # oauth mode
curl http://localhost:8000/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server       # oauth-proxy mode

# OAuthProxy mode also exposes DCR
curl -I http://localhost:8000/register

# /health probes Doorkeeper introspection in OAuth mode
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# {"status": "ok", "checks": {"introspection": "ok"}, ...}
```

If `/health` returns `"status": "degraded"` with `"introspection": "unreachable"`, the introspection client is misconfigured (see Step 2 — verify the client is **confidential** and that the `allow_token_introspection` block in `30-redmine.rb` was applied per Step 2b).

### Endpoints exposed in OAuth mode

In both `oauth` and `oauth-proxy` modes the server exposes the OAuth2 metadata and token-management endpoints that MCP clients rely on:

| Endpoint | Standard | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` | RFC 9728 §3.1 | Tells clients where to find the authorization server (mounted by FastMCP `RemoteAuthProvider`) |
| `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/mcp` | RFC 8414 | Advertises Redmine's Doorkeeper OAuth endpoints, scoped to this MCP resource |
| `POST /revoke` | RFC 7009 | Revokes an OAuth2 token (proxies to Redmine's `/oauth/revoke`) |

Redmine uses the [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper) gem for OAuth2 but does not serve the RFC 8414 discovery document itself. This server serves path-scoped metadata on Redmine's behalf, pointing to Redmine's real `/oauth/authorize`, `/oauth/token`, and `/oauth/revoke` endpoints.

## Step 5: Connect Your MCP Client

MCP clients handle the OAuth flow automatically — when connecting to the server, the client opens a browser for the user to log in to Redmine. No manual token management needed.

### Client Compatibility

| Client | OAuth2 | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **VS Code** (1.102+) | Yes | Full OAuth 2.1 with PKCE and DCR |
| **Claude Code** | Yes | Auto browser flow on 401. Use `--callback-port` for fixed port |
| **Claude Desktop** | Yes | Via Settings → Connectors. Requires DCR |
| **Codex CLI** | Yes | Use `codex mcp login`. Configurable callback port |
| **Kiro** | Yes | Configurable `oauth.redirectUri`. Implementation is newer |

### Redirect URIs

Set this in Redmine's OAuth app (Step 1) to match your client:

| Client | Redirect URI |
|--------|-------------|
| VS Code | `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/callback` |
| Claude Code | `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/oauth/callback` |
| Codex CLI | `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/callback` |
| Kiro | Configurable via `oauth.redirectUri` |

> **Note on DCR:** Some clients (Claude Desktop, VS Code) expect Dynamic Client Registration. Redmine's Doorkeeper does not support DCR, so you must pre-register the app manually (Step 1) and configure the client with the `client_id`/`client_secret`.
> Use `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth-proxy` when MCP clients need DCR/CIMD onboarding.

## Scope Enforcement

The server enforces OAuth scopes per tool (on by default). Every MCP
tool maps to the Redmine permission scopes it needs, and a
call is refused with code `INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE` when the access token
does not carry them. `tools/list` only shows the tools the token can
use. Tokens with the `admin` scope bypass the check, matching Redmine's
own semantics.

The authoritative tool-to-scope map is `TOOL_SCOPES` in
`src/redmine_mcp_server/oauth_scopes.py`.

Notes:

- The map gates each tool's base permission. Argument-conditional
  permissions (for example `manage_subtasks` when changing
  `parent_issue_id`, or tag scopes for `tag_list`) are still enforced
  by Redmine itself.
- RedmineUP plugin tools (`manage_product`, `manage_contact`,
  `manage_deal`, checklists) do not require plugin scopes in the map;
  Redmine enforces its own plugin permissions for them. `manage_contact`
  and `manage_deal` are special cases: setting `REDMINE_CRM_ENABLED` adds
  the contacts permissions to the advertised scopes and
  `REDMINE_DEALS_ENABLED` adds the deal permissions, because Redmine
  intersects a token's scopes with the user's role permissions and would
  otherwise deny every contacts call and every deals call. They are advertised so the token can carry them, but not
  required here, since a deployment with the flag off never advertises
  them. Grant them on the OAuth application when enabling either flag.
- Deals sit behind their own flag rather than `REDMINE_CRM_ENABLED`
  because the CRM plugin's Light edition defines no deal permissions at
  all. Redmine builds its OAuth scope list from
  `Redmine::AccessControl.permissions` and applies
  `enforce_configured_scopes`, so on Light a deal scope cannot be held by
  the OAuth application and requesting it fails consent with
  `invalid_scope` -- which would break `manage_contact` too.
- A notes-only `update_redmine_issue` call (fields containing nothing but
  `notes` / `private_notes`, no uploads) requires `add_issue_notes` instead
  of `edit_issues`, mirroring Redmine's own note-adding permission.

### Tokens issued before scope enforcement

Tokens obtained before scopes were requested (or from OAuth apps with a
blank scope list) introspect with empty scopes and will be denied for
every tool. Fix: update the OAuth application's scopes in Redmine,
disconnect and re-authorize the MCP client so a new consent grants the
scopes. As a temporary bridge you can set:

```bash
REDMINE_OAUTH_SCOPE_ENFORCEMENT=off
```

which restores the pre-enforcement behavior (any active token can call
any tool) and logs a warning at startup. Re-enable it once clients have
re-consented.

### Cursor and self-AS discovery

Some MCP clients (for example Cursor) discover the authorization server by
probing its canonical RFC 8414 well-known location. Because stock `oauth`
mode names Redmine as the authorization server and no released Redmine
Doorkeeper serves `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, those clients
fail discovery.

Set `REDMINE_OAUTH_DISCOVERY_AS=self` so this server advertises itself as the
authorization server (issuer = `REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL`) and serves the RFC 8414
document at its own canonical well-known location. Authorize and token
requests still go directly to Redmine `/oauth/authorize` and `/oauth/token`,
so the client keeps using its static confidential client registered in
Redmine. This mode is opt-in; the default `redmine` mode is unchanged.

If the Redmine OAuth Application enables only a subset of permissions, also
set `REDMINE_MCP_SCOPES` to that subset so the advertised `scopes_supported`
matches what the Application can grant and consent does not fail with
`invalid_scope`.

`REDMINE_MCP_SCOPES` is a subset of the scopes this server already advertises
(the Redmine permissions its tools actually use), not a mirror of the
Application's full permission list. Permissions your Application grants but no
MCP tool uses (for example `view_gantt`, `copy_issues`, `edit_own_time_entries`)
are not in that set and are rejected at boot; leave them out of
`REDMINE_MCP_SCOPES`. The boot error lists the full set of accepted scopes.

Note: `REDMINE_OAUTH_DISCOVERY_AS` and `REDMINE_MCP_SCOPES` apply to `oauth`
mode only and are ignored in `oauth-proxy` mode, where this server is the
authorization-server gateway.

The `oauth-proxy` mode is a different model (this server proxies authorize and
token and issues its own client registrations); it is the alternative when you
want a full authorization-server gateway rather than direct-to-Redmine consent.

## Migrating from Legacy Mode

1. Set `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth` and restart — no downtime needed
2. Remove legacy credentials from `.env` once confirmed working
3. To rollback: set `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=legacy` (or remove the variable)

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `{"error": "unauthorized"}` | Missing Bearer token | Check client is sending `Authorization` header |
| `{"error": "invalid_token"}` | Token failed Doorkeeper introspection (revoked, expired, or invalid) | Test with `curl $REDMINE_URL/oauth/introspect -u "$REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID:$REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_SECRET" -d "token=<bearer>&token_type_hint=access_token"` |
| Every MCP call returns 401 | Introspection client not authorized to introspect tokens of other apps | Re-check Step 2b's `allow_token_introspection` block in `30-redmine.rb`. Confirm the introspection client is **Confidential: Yes**. |
| `/health` returns `status: "degraded"` | Introspection endpoint unreachable | Check `REDMINE_URL`, introspection credentials, and Doorkeeper's `allow_token_introspection` setting |
| Server fails to start: "Missing env var(s): REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID..." | OAuth mode requires introspection creds | Register the introspection client per Step 2, set `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID` / `_SECRET` |
| Discovery endpoints 404 | Not in OAuth mode, or hitting wrong path | Ensure `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth`. Note: the canonical paths are `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` (suffix-scoped per RFC 9728 §3.1) and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/mcp` |
| Token works in Redmine but not MCP | Wrong `REDMINE_URL` | In Docker, use internal hostname (e.g., `http://redmine:3000`) |
| "Applications" menu missing | Redmine too old | Requires Redmine 6.1+ |

For more diagnostic flows (including the "all MCP requests return 401" symptom flow and emergency rollback to legacy mode), see `docs/troubleshooting.md`.

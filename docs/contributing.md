## Where things live

After v2.0, the codebase is organized by resource:

### Tool implementations

Tools live under `src/redmine_mcp_server/tools/`, one file per Redmine resource; the interactive MCP Apps tools live under `src/redmine_mcp_server/apps/`:

| File | Tools |
|---|---|
| `tools/projects.py` | Project records, listing, versions, members, roles, modules (11 tools) |
| `tools/issues.py` | Issues, search, copy, delete, relations, watchers, notes, categories, subtasks, private notes (13 tools) |
| `tools/time_tracking.py` | Time entries, activities, bulk import (4 tools) |
| `tools/wiki.py` | Wiki page CRUD + rename (1 tool, 6 actions) |
| `tools/news.py` | Project news: list, get, create/update, delete (4 tools) |
| `tools/files.py` | File upload/download/delete, attachment URLs, ticketed upload staging (5 tools, plus `cleanup_attachment_files` admin-gated) |
| `tools/enumeration.py` | Trackers, statuses, priorities, users, queries (6 tools) |
| `tools/search.py` | Global search across resources (1 tool) |
| `tools/checklists.py` | RedmineUP Checklists plugin (3 tools, gated) |
| `tools/gantt.py` | Gantt chart composite read tool (1 tool) |
| `tools/products.py` | RedmineUP Products plugin (1 tool, gated) |
| `tools/contacts.py` | RedmineUP CRM contacts and contact tags (2 tools, gated) |
| `tools/crm_notes.py` | RedmineUP CRM notes on contacts and deals (1 tool, gated on either CRM flag) |
| `tools/crm_queries.py` | RedmineUP CRM saved queries (1 tool, gated on either CRM flag) |
| `tools/deals.py` | RedmineUP CRM deals, deal statuses, deal categories, deal product lines (4 tools, gated) |
| `tools/documents.py` | DMSF plugin documents (1 tool with list/get/create/update actions, gated) |
| `tools/meta.py` | Server introspection: `get_mcp_server_info` (1 tool, always available) |
| `apps/triage_board.py` | Interactive Kanban triage board MCP App (2 tools) |
| `apps/project_dashboard.py` | Interactive project dashboard MCP App (2 tools) |

Total: **51 core MCP tools** always registered, **13 plugin-gated** tools registered with a family tag and listed only when their `REDMINE_*_ENABLED` flag is set (64 with every plugin on), **plus 1 admin-gated** (`cleanup_attachment_files`, enabled by `REDMINE_MCP_EXPOSE_ADMIN_TOOLS=true`) for a maximum of 65.

Each `tools/<resource>.py` also owns its resource-specific serializers (`_X_to_dict` helpers).

### Shared helpers

Cross-cutting utilities live as flat private modules:

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `_client.py` | Redmine connection (legacy, `legacy-per-user`, `oauth`, `oauth-proxy`, and `api-key-login`), module-level config, logger |
| `_errors.py` | `_handle_redmine_error`, `_scrub_error_message`, `_READ_ONLY_ERROR` |
| `_validation.py` | Input validators (`_is_positive_int`, `_is_valid_project_id`, `_validate_hours`) |
| `_serialization.py` | `wrap_insecure_content`, `_safe_isoformat`, `_iter_capped`, `_named_ref`, `_coerce_json_safe`, `_normalize_csv_list` |
| `_env.py` | Environment accessors: read-only / plugin flags (`_is_read_only_mode`, `_is_*_enabled`), secret resolution with Docker/Kubernetes `*_FILE` support (`get_secret`, `get_required`, `get_required_secret`), `require_introspection_credentials`, `get_allowed_client_redirect_uris` (oauth-proxy redirect-URI allowlist), `get_health_introspection_ttl_seconds`, `get_extension_modules` (parses `REDMINE_MCP_EXTENSIONS`) |
| `_custom_fields.py` | Custom-field parsing, autofill, and update coercion |
| `_ssrf.py` | SSRF protection for `upload_file`'s `source_url` |
| `_cleanup.py` | Background cleanup task |
| `_http_routes.py` | Starlette routes (`/health` with a Doorkeeper introspection probe in `oauth` / `oauth-proxy` modes, a reachability probe in `legacy-per-user` / `api-key-login` modes, and a Redmine credential probe in legacy mode, `/files/{id}`, `/cleanup/status`) |
| `_decorators.py` | `@action_dispatch` decorator + `ActionMode` enum |
| `_offload.py` | `@offloaded` decorator and `in_thread()`: run blocking python-redmine work in a worker thread instead of on the event loop |
| `_auth.py` | `RedmineAuthProvider` (a `RemoteAuthProvider` subclass) and its `build_remote_auth()` factory: composes `IntrospectionTokenVerifier` (RFC 7662) and adds the RFC 8414 AS-metadata mirror plus the RFC 7009 `/revoke` route. Used by `oauth` mode. |
| `_oauth_proxy.py` | `build_oauth_proxy()` factory: a FastMCP `OAuthProxy` backed by `IntrospectionTokenVerifier`, proxying `/authorize`, `/token`, and `/revoke` to Doorkeeper with external consent and a loopback-default redirect-URI allowlist. Used by `oauth-proxy` mode. |
| `_api_key_login.py` | `api-key-login` mode: `ApiKeyLoginProvider` (an `OAuthProvider` subclass that is its own authorization server), the encrypted binding store and its factory `build_api_key_login()`, refresh-time key revalidation, and `BindingRevocationMiddleware` (revokes a binding when Redmine answers 401). |
| `_api_key_login_routes.py` | `api-key-login` mode: the `GET`/`POST /login` page that collects a user's API key, its browser-binding cookie, and the login rate limit. |
| `_mount.py` | Public base-URL helpers (`mcp_base_url`, `mcp_path_for_http_app`, `mcp_mount_prefix`) for serving the authenticated app behind `REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL`. |
| `_tool_error_middleware.py` | FastMCP middleware that surfaces tool-validation errors with a clean payload. |
| `oauth_scopes.py` | `READ_SCOPES` / `WRITE_SCOPES` inventory + `advertised_scopes()` used by both the protected-resource and AS-metadata discovery documents. |
| `extensions.py` | The public — and for now provisional — surface an out-of-tree extension imports: `ExtensionSpec`, `register_extension`, and the helpers a tool needs, re-exported without their leading underscore. `main.py` imports the modules `REDMINE_MCP_EXTENSIONS` names. |
| `_extension_registry.py` | `REGISTERED_EXTENSIONS` and `extension_advertised_scopes()`, kept out of `extensions.py` so `oauth_scopes.advertised_scopes()` can read them while `server.py` is still building the auth provider, without an import cycle. |

### Keeping blocking calls off the event loop

python-redmine is synchronous, so any tool that calls it on the event loop
stalls every other request until the call returns, including `/health`
([#216](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/216)). Two rules
follow, and `_get_redmine_client()` enforces them at runtime: it raises if it
is called on the event loop thread.

**Rule 1: if the function has no `await`, make it a plain `def` and decorate it
with `@offloaded`.** This is most tools and every per-action handler.

```python
from .._offload import offloaded

@mcp.tool()
@offloaded
def list_widgets(project_id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    ...
```

**Rule 2: if the function must stay a coroutine because it awaits something,
wrap its synchronous remainder in a nested closure and hand that to
`in_thread()`.**

```python
from .._offload import in_thread

@mcp.tool()
async def get_widget(widget_id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    await _ensure_cleanup_started()

    def _run() -> Dict[str, Any]:
        try:
            widget = _get_redmine_client().widget.get(widget_id)
            return _widget_to_dict(widget)
        except Exception as e:
            return _handle_redmine_error(e, f"fetching widget {widget_id}")

    return await in_thread(_run)
```

Use a nested closure rather than a separate top-level function so parameters
are captured instead of re-declared in a second signature. If the closure
assigns to a name that also exists outside it, add a `nonlocal` for that name,
otherwise Python makes it a closure-local and the read before assignment raises
`UnboundLocalError`.

Move the **whole** synchronous section in one hop, not just the client call.
python-redmine issues its HTTP request on the first iteration of a result set,
not at `.filter()`, and re-fetches on attribute access for a field that was not
included, so iteration and serialization block too.

`tests/test_offload.py` has a static check that fails with the offending file,
line, and function if a blocking call is left on the loop.

### Adding a new `manage_X` tool

The 9 `manage_X` tools (plus `manage_redmine_version`) follow a consistent pattern via the `@action_dispatch` decorator. Example:

```python
from .._decorators import ActionMode, action_dispatch
from .._offload import offloaded

# Per-action handlers (private functions in the same file). They are plain
# `def` carrying @offloaded, so the blocking Redmine work runs in a worker
# thread; action_dispatch awaits them exactly the same way.
@offloaded
def _list_widgets_action(project_id=None, **_):
    # validation, fetch, return
    ...

@offloaded
def _create_widget_action(project_id=None, name=None, **_):
    # validation, create, return
    ...

@mcp.tool()
@action_dispatch({
    "list": ActionMode.READ,
    "create": ActionMode.WRITE,
})
async def manage_widget(action: str, project_id=None, name=None):
    """Docstring with full param/return shape."""
    return {
        "list": _list_widgets_action,
        "create": _create_widget_action,
    }
```

The decorator handles:
- Action validation (returns `{"error": "Invalid action ..."}` on bad input)
- Read-only guard for `WRITE` actions (returns `_READ_ONLY_ERROR` if env enables read-only mode)
- `_ensure_cleanup_started()` for `WRITE` actions
- Routing to the per-action handler

Per-action handlers stay responsible for: their own parameter validation, calling the Redmine API, and wrapping exceptions via `_handle_redmine_error`.

**Important:** keep the public `manage_X` tool's full explicit parameter list (FastMCP rejects `**kwargs` in tool signatures). Only the body changes to return the handler-map dict.

For plugin-gated tools (`manage_product`, `manage_contact`, `manage_deal`), wrap the dispatcher in a feature-flag check:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def manage_widget(action: str, project_id=None, name=None):
    if not _is_widgets_enabled():
        return dict(_WIDGETS_DISABLED_ERROR)
    return await _manage_widget_dispatch(
        action,
        project_id=project_id,
        name=name,
    )


@action_dispatch({...})
async def _manage_widget_dispatch(action, **kwargs):
    return {...}
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or a bug fix branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Make Changes

- Write clear, maintainable code
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Update relevant documentation

### 3. Write Tests

**Test Types:**

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions with mocks
- **Integration Tests**: Test with actual Redmine server
- **Security Tests**: Test input validation and security

**Running Tests:**

```bash
# All tests
python tests/run_tests.py --all

# Unit tests only (no external dependencies)
python tests/run_tests.py

# Integration tests (requires Redmine server)
python tests/run_tests.py --integration

# With coverage report
python tests/run_tests.py --coverage
```

**Live CRM Integration Tests:**

`tests/test_crm_integration.py` exercises every REST action the RedmineUP CRM PRO plugin exposes (24 in total, one test each: contacts, contact project links, contact tags, notes, saved queries, deals, deal product lines, deal statuses and deal categories) through the MCP tool functions against a real server. It runs as part of `--integration` and skips itself when `GET /contacts.json` is not 200, so a plain Redmine still passes; the product line test additionally skips without the Products plugin.

The server it targets needs: CRM PRO (deals) and optionally Products installed; the API user's role holding the contact, deal, note and product permissions; the `contacts`, `deals` and `products` modules enabled on the test project; at least one deal status; and a second project the user is a member of (for the contact project association test). Override the defaults with `REDMINE_TEST_PROJECT` (default `testing-project1`) and `REDMINE_TEST_DEAL_STATUS_ID` (default `1`). Every test creates and deletes its own records.

**Live OAuth Integration Tests (v2.1+):**

The unit suite mocks Doorkeeper at the httpx transport boundary. To exercise real Doorkeeper RFC 7662 introspection against a sandbox Redmine:

1. Register an MCP introspection client in the sandbox per `docs/oauth-setup.md` Step 2.
2. Mint a valid bearer for any user-flow OAuth app in the same sandbox.
3. Add the four env vars to your `.env` file:

   ```bash
   REDMINE_URL=https://sandbox-redmine.example.com
   REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID=...
   REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   REDMINE_OAUTH_TEST_TOKEN=...
   ```

   The OAuth integration test module calls `load_dotenv()` at import time, so vars in `.env` are picked up automatically — no need to re-export on the command line.

4. Run the full integration suite:

   ```bash
   python tests/run_tests.py --integration
   ```

   …or run just the OAuth subset (needs direct pytest because `run_tests.py` does not forward `-k`):

   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/test_oauth_integration.py -v -m integration
   ```

If any required env var is missing, the OAuth tests skip with a clear "Live OAuth integration not configured" message — safe to leave in CI.

The destructive `test_revoked_token_rejected` test invalidates the test bearer and is skipped by default. To enable (and lose the bearer):

```bash
RUN_DESTRUCTIVE_TESTS=1 python tests/run_tests.py --integration
```

Re-mint the test bearer through the sandbox's OAuth user-flow before re-running.

**Plugin-gated integration tests:**

Some integration tests need a Redmine plugin installed on the target server, so they are opt-in behind an environment flag and skip with a clear reason otherwise:

| Flag | Plugin | Covers |
|------|--------|--------|
| `REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED=true` | RedmineUP Agile | `story_points`, `agile_sprint_id`, `agile_position` |
| `REDMINE_TAGS_ENABLED=true` | `additional_tags` | the `tags` array and `tag_list` writes |
| `REDMINE_DRAWIO_ENABLED=true` | `redmine_drawio` | `{{drawio_attach(...)}}` rendering a `.drawio` upload |

The first two are read by the server itself; `REDMINE_DRAWIO_ENABLED` is test-only, since the drawio plugin needs no server-side support (a `.drawio` upload is an ordinary binary attachment). The drawio test asserts against the *rendered* wiki HTML rather than the REST response, because the API returns raw wiki source, which cannot show whether the macro expanded. Set the flag only against a server that has the plugin; without it the test fails rather than skips, which is deliberate: the flag is the opt-in, so a silently broken plugin still surfaces.

```bash
REDMINE_DRAWIO_ENABLED=true python -m pytest tests/test_integration.py -m integration -k drawio
```

**Writing Tests:**

```python
# Example unit test
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_list_projects():
    """Test listing projects with mocked Redmine client."""
    # Test implementation
    pass

# Example integration test
@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_list_projects_integration():
    """Test listing projects with real Redmine server."""
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

### 4. Code Quality Checks

**PEP 8 Compliance:**

```bash
# Check compliance
uv run flake8 src/ --max-line-length=88

# Auto-format code
uv run black src/ --line-length=88

# Verify formatting without changes
uv run black --check src/
```

**Code Style Guidelines:**

- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black's default)
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
- Write descriptive variable and function names

### 5. Commit Your Changes

**Commit Message Format:**

Follow conventional commits:

```

```

## Code Guidelines

### Python Style

```python
# Good: Clear function with type hints and docstring
@offloaded
def get_issue(issue_id: int, include_journals: bool = True) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Retrieve detailed information about a Redmine issue.

    Args:
        issue_id: The ID of the issue to retrieve
        include_journals: Whether to include journal entries

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing issue details

    Raises:
        ValueError: If issue_id is invalid
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Error Handling

```python
# Good: Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
try:
    issue = redmine.issue.get(issue_id)
    return _issue_to_dict(issue)
except Exception as e:
    return {"error": f"Failed to retrieve issue {issue_id}: {str(e)}"}
```

### MCP Tool Implementation

```python
# Good: MCP tool with clear documentation.
# Plain `def` + @offloaded so the blocking Redmine call runs in a worker
# thread. See "Keeping blocking calls off the event loop" above for the
# case where the tool has to stay a coroutine.
@mcp.tool()
@offloaded
def tool_name(param: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Brief description of what this tool does.

    Args:
        param: Description of parameter

    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```python
# tests/test_example.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_function_success():
    """Test successful execution."""
    # Arrange
    mock_data = {"id": 1, "name": "test"}

    # Act
    result = await function_to_test(mock_data)

    # Assert
    assert result["id"] == 1
    assert result["name"] == "test"

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_function_error():
    """Test error handling."""
    # Test error scenarios
    pass
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test both success and error paths
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests

## Documentation

### Update Documentation When:

- Adding new features or tools
- Changing existing functionality
- Fixing bugs that affect usage
- Adding new configuration options

### Documentation Files:

- `README.md` - Keep concise with references to detailed docs
- `docs/tool-reference.md` - Tool usage details
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `docs/contributing.md` - This file
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history

### Documentation Style:

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add links to related documentation
- Keep formatting consistent

## Pull Request Process

### Start with an Issue (for features and non-trivial changes)

For new features, behavior changes, or any non-trivial work, please open a
GitHub issue (or discussion) first and wait for maintainer feedback before
writing code. This avoids wasted effort on changes that may not fit the
project's scope or direction, and gives the PR a place to link back to
(`Fixes #N`).

Small bug fixes, documentation typos, and other obviously-correct changes can
go straight to a PR without an issue.

### Before Submitting:

1. ✅ All tests pass locally
2. ✅ Code formatted with Black
3. ✅ Flake8 checks pass
4. ✅ Documentation updated
5. ✅ CHANGELOG.md updated (for features/fixes)
6. ✅ Commit messages follow conventions

### PR Template:

GitHub pre-fills new pull requests from
[`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
Fill in the Summary, Changes, and Testing sections and work through its
checklist (tests, formatting, CHANGELOG, docs, no manual version bumps,
and both deployment methods verified).

### Review Process:

1. Automated checks run (CI/CD)
2. Maintainer reviews code
3. Address review feedback
4. Approval and merge

## Deployment Compatibility

**Important:** All solutions must work with both deployment methods:

### Local Python Execution
```bash
uv run python -m redmine_mcp_server.main
```
- Uses `.env` for configuration
- For development and debugging

### Docker Deployment
```bash
docker-compose up
```
- Uses `.env.docker` for configuration
- For production deployments

**Always test both deployment methods before submitting!**

## Release Process

Releases are driven entirely by `scripts/release.py`. The script owns every
version-touching action (`pyproject.toml`, `server.json`, `uv.lock`,
`CHANGELOG.md`), the gitflow ceremony, tagging, the GitHub release, and the
MCP Registry publish. **Never bump versions by hand**; contributors only add
entries under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`.

See [RELEASE_SOP.md](../RELEASE_SOP.md) for complete release procedures.

### Core Components

- **`main.py`**: Entry point. In an authenticated mode (`oauth`, `oauth-proxy` or `api-key-login`), `build_authenticated_app()` mounts the FastMCP app under the `REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL` path prefix and adds the provider's `get_well_known_routes()` (discovery) plus `/health`, `/files`, `/cleanup/status`; in legacy mode it returns `mcp.http_app(stateless_http=True)`. Tool registration is triggered via `from . import tools`. No Starlette middleware is added; auth lives inside FastMCP via the `auth=` constructor parameter.
- **`server.py`**: Owns the shared `mcp = FastMCP("redmine_mcp_tools", auth=...)` instance imported by every tool module. `_select_auth_provider(auth_mode)` returns `build_remote_auth()` (a `RedmineAuthProvider`) for `oauth`, `build_oauth_proxy()` (a FastMCP `OAuthProxy`) for `oauth-proxy`, `build_api_key_login()` (an `ApiKeyLoginProvider`) for `api-key-login`, and `None` for legacy.
- **`_auth.py`** (`oauth` mode): `build_remote_auth()` returns a `RedmineAuthProvider`, a `RemoteAuthProvider` subclass that composes `IntrospectionTokenVerifier` (RFC 7662 against Doorkeeper's `/oauth/introspect`) and additionally serves the RFC 8414 AS-metadata mirror and the RFC 7009 `/revoke` route. Reads `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID` / `_SECRET` via `_env.require_introspection_credentials()` (fail-fast on startup).
- **`_oauth_proxy.py`** (`oauth-proxy` mode): `build_oauth_proxy()` returns a FastMCP `OAuthProxy` that makes the MCP server the OAuth authorization server for clients (DCR + `/authorize` / `/token` / `/register`) and proxies upstream to Redmine/Doorkeeper, validating tokens with the same `IntrospectionTokenVerifier`. Keeps consent external (`require_authorization_consent="external"`), requires `REDMINE_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`, and restricts client redirect URIs to loopback by default (`get_allowed_client_redirect_uris()`).
- **`tools/`**: Per-resource tool modules. Each file owns its `@mcp.tool()` definitions and resource-specific serializers (`_X_to_dict` helpers). See [Where things live](#where-things-live) earlier in this guide for the full table.
- **Flat `_X.py` modules**: Cross-cutting helpers (`_client`, `_errors`, `_validation`, `_serialization`, `_env`, `_custom_fields`, `_ssrf`, `_cleanup`, `_http_routes`, `_decorators`, `_auth`, `_oauth_proxy`, `_api_key_login`, `_api_key_login_routes`, `_mount`, `_tool_error_middleware`). See [Where things live](#where-things-live) for responsibilities.
- **`_client.py`**: In `oauth` and `oauth-proxy` modes, builds a per-request `Redmine(...)` from the bearer returned by `fastmcp.server.dependencies.get_access_token()`. In `api-key-login` mode, builds it from the Redmine API key bound to the access token's claims, checked before the bearer branch. In legacy mode, caches a singleton built from `REDMINE_API_KEY` or `REDMINE_USERNAME`/`REDMINE_PASSWORD`. (Pre-v2.1: validated tokens via `GET /users/current.json` through a custom `ContextVar`-based middleware; both removed in the v2.1 native-auth migration.)
- **`oauth_scopes.py`**: Single source of truth for `scopes_supported` in the protected-resource and AS-metadata discovery documents. Filters `WRITE_SCOPES` out when `REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY=true`, appends the agile read scope (`view_agile_queries`) when `REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED=true`, and the tags scopes when `REDMINE_TAGS_ENABLED=true` — `view_issue_tags` (read) always, plus `create_issue_tags`/`edit_issue_tags` (write) unless read-only.
- **`file_manager.py`**: Attachment file storage manager (UUID-based files + metadata.json with expiry).

This layout was introduced in v2.0 (replacing the previous monolithic `redmine_handler.py`), updated in v2.1 (auth moved from `oauth_middleware.py` to native FastMCP `auth=` via `_auth.py`), and extended in v2.3 with the `oauth-proxy` mode (`_oauth_proxy.py`, `_mount.py`, and the `RemoteAuthProvider` → `RedmineAuthProvider` refactor).

### Key Technologies

- **FastMCP**: MCP protocol implementation with HTTP transport
- **python-redmine**: Official Redmine Python library
- **Starlette**: ASGI HTTP framework
- **uvicorn**: ASGI server

### Design Patterns

- Async/await for non-blocking operations
- Error handling with user-friendly error dictionaries
- Per-resource serializer helpers (`_issue_to_dict`, `_project_to_dict`, etc.)
- `@action_dispatch` decorator for `manage_X` tools (action validation, read-only guard, cleanup hook)
- Environment-based configuration with `.env` files

## Adding New Tools

To add a new MCP tool to the server:

1. **Pick the right `tools/<resource>.py` file** (or create a new one if the resource doesn't fit any existing module). See [Where things live](#where-things-live) for the file/resource mapping.

2. **Define the tool** in that file:

   ```python
   from ..server import mcp
   from .._errors import _handle_redmine_error
   from .._offload import offloaded

   @mcp.tool()
   @offloaded
   def your_new_tool(param: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       """
       Brief description of what this tool does.

       Args:
           param: Description of the parameter

       Returns:
           Dictionary with results or error information
       """
       try:
           # Your implementation here
           result = perform_operation(param)
           return {"success": True, "data": result}
       except Exception as e:
           return _handle_redmine_error(e, "your_new_tool")
   ```

3. **The tool is automatically registered** — FastMCP discovers tools decorated with `@mcp.tool()` once the module is imported. New `tools/<resource>.py` files must be imported from `tools/__init__.py`.

4. **For `manage_X`-style tools** (multi-action CRUD), use the `@action_dispatch` decorator. See [Adding a new `manage_X` tool](#adding-a-new-manage_x-tool) earlier in this guide.

5. **Test your tool**:
   - Add unit tests in `tests/test_<resource>_tools.py` (or the matching existing file)
   - Add integration tests if it interacts with Redmine
   - Run tests: `python tests/run_tests.py --all`

6. **Document your tool**:
   - Add entry to `docs/tool-reference.md`
   - Include parameters, returns, and examples
   - Update README tool count if needed

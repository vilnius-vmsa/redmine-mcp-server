# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common issues and solutions for the Redmine MCP Server.

## Connection Issues

### Cannot Connect to Redmine Server

**Symptoms:**
- "Connection refused" errors
- "Failed to connect to Redmine" messages
- Server health check fails

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Redmine URL**
   ```bash
   # Check your .env file
   cat .env | grep REDMINE_URL

   # Test connectivity with curl
   curl -I https://your-redmine-server.com
   ```

2. **Check Network Connectivity**
   - Ensure you can reach the Redmine server from your network
   - Verify no firewall blocking the connection
   - Check if VPN is required for access

3. **Verify Redmine Server is Running**
   - Access your Redmine URL in a web browser
   - Check with your Redmine administrator if server is up

### Network Timeout Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "Redmine at ... did not respond in time"
- "Timed out connecting to Redmine at ..."

**Solutions:**

1. **Distinguish the two messages**
   - "Timed out connecting" means the host or port never accepted the
     connection. Check the URL, DNS, and any firewall or proxy in between.
   - "did not respond in time" means Redmine accepted the connection but sent
     no response within the read budget. The server is reachable but slow or
     stuck.

2. **Raise the Limit for a Slow Redmine**
   - `REDMINE_TIMEOUT` defaults to 30 seconds. Large queries against a busy
     instance may legitimately need more: `REDMINE_TIMEOUT=120`.
   - Setting `REDMINE_TIMEOUT=0` disables the timeout entirely. Avoid it: a
     Redmine that accepts a connection and never answers will hang the
     request forever.

3. **Reduce the Work per Call**
   - Lower `limit` on list tools, or use the `fields` parameter of
     `list_redmine_issues` to return fewer fields.
   - Use `journal_limit` on `get_redmine_issue` for issues with long
     comment histories.

**Note on large attachments:** the read timeout measures the gap between
bytes, not total transfer time, so a slow but steady download is not cut off
by it. An upload works the other way: after the file body is sent, the
client still waits under the same read timeout for Redmine's response, so a
large upload to a busy instance may need a higher `REDMINE_TIMEOUT` even
though the transfer itself completed.

### SSL Certificate Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "SSL certificate verify failed" errors
- "CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED" messages
- "SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED" in connection errors
- "SSLError" or "CertificateError" messages

**Solutions:**

1. **Use HTTPS URLs**
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   REDMINE_URL=https://your-redmine-server.com  # Not http://
   ```

2. **Self-Signed Certificates**

   If your Redmine server uses a self-signed certificate or internal CA, configure the custom CA certificate:

   ```bash
   # In .env file
   REDMINE_URL=https://redmine.company.com
   REDMINE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   REDMINE_SSL_CERT=/path/to/ca-certificate.crt
   ```

   **Supported certificate formats:** `.pem`, `.crt`, `.cer`

   **Obtaining the certificate:**
   ```bash
   # Export certificate from browser (Chrome/Firefox)
   # Or get from system administrator

   # Or download from server (if accessible)
   openssl s_client -connect redmine.company.com:443 -showcerts < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | \
     openssl x509 -outform PEM > ca-cert.pem
   ```

3. **Mutual TLS (Client Certificates)**

   For environments requiring client certificate authentication:

   **Option A: Separate certificate and key files**
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   REDMINE_URL=https://secure.redmine.com
   REDMINE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   REDMINE_SSL_CERT=/path/to/ca-bundle.pem
   REDMINE_SSL_CLIENT_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem,/path/to/key.pem
   ```

   **Option B: Combined certificate file**
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   REDMINE_SSL_CLIENT_CERT=/path/to/combined-cert.pem
   ```

   **Important:** Private keys must be unencrypted (Python requests library requirement)

   **Removing password from encrypted key:**
   ```bash
   openssl rsa -in encrypted-key.pem -out unencrypted-key.pem
   ```

4. **Disable SSL Verification (Development Only)**

   ⚠️ **WARNING:** Only use in development/testing environments!

   ```bash
   # In .env file
   REDMINE_SSL_VERIFY=false
   ```

   Disabling SSL verification makes your connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Never use in production.

   The server pins this choice: when `REDMINE_SSL_VERIFY=false` or `REDMINE_SSL_CERT` is set, a CA bundle named by `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` or `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` is ignored for Redmine connections, since it would otherwise override the setting. Proxy variables (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`) still apply, and the server logs a warning naming any of these variables it finds.

   If verification still fails with `certificate verify failed` after disabling it, check whether an HTTPS proxy is in play: with `HTTPS_PROXY=https://...`, the proxy's own certificate is verified regardless of this setting, and the error is reported against the destination host. Point the proxy variable at an `http://` endpoint, or add the proxy's CA to the trust store on the machine running the server.

5. **Certificate File Not Found**

   **Symptoms:**
   - "SSL certificate not found: /path/to/cert.pem"
   - "FileNotFoundError" for certificate path

   **Solutions:**
   - Verify the certificate file path is correct
   - Use absolute paths instead of relative paths
   - Check file permissions (must be readable)
   ```bash
   # Verify certificate file exists
   ls -la /path/to/ca-cert.pem

   # Check file permissions
   chmod 644 /path/to/ca-cert.pem
   ```

6. **Certificate Path is a Directory**

   **Symptoms:**
   - "SSL certificate path must be a file, not directory"

   **Solutions:**
   - Specify the actual certificate file, not the directory
   ```bash
   # Wrong
   REDMINE_SSL_CERT=/etc/ssl/certs/

   # Correct
   REDMINE_SSL_CERT=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
   ```

7. **Certificate Validation Errors with Custom CA**

   **Symptoms:**
   - Still getting SSL errors even with `REDMINE_SSL_CERT` configured

   **Solutions:**
   - Verify you have the correct CA certificate (not the server certificate)
   - Ensure certificate chain is complete
   - Test certificate validation:
   ```bash
   # Test SSL connection with custom CA
   openssl s_client -connect redmine.company.com:443 \
     -CAfile /path/to/ca-cert.pem
   ```

8. **Docker Deployment SSL Configuration**

   When using Docker, mount certificates into container:

   ```bash
   # In docker-compose.yml
   volumes:
     - ./certs:/certs:ro
   ```

   ```bash
   # In .env.docker
   REDMINE_SSL_CERT=/certs/ca-cert.pem
   REDMINE_SSL_CLIENT_CERT=/certs/client-cert.pem,/certs/client-key.pem
   ```

**Troubleshooting Checklist:**
- [ ] Verified `REDMINE_URL` uses `https://`
- [ ] Certificate file exists at specified path
- [ ] Certificate file is readable (permissions 644 or similar)
- [ ] Using correct CA certificate (not server certificate)
- [ ] For mutual TLS: client private key is unencrypted
- [ ] For Docker: certificates mounted into container
- [ ] Tested SSL connection with `openssl s_client`

**See also:** [README.md - SSL Certificate Configuration](../README.md#ssl-certificate-configuration) for configuration examples.

## Authentication Issues

### Server Unexpectedly Requires OAuth / "unauthorized" Error

**Symptoms:**
- MCP client fails to connect with `{"error":"unauthorized"}`
- Server returns `401 Unauthorized` with a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` header
- Health endpoint shows `"auth_mode":"oauth"` or `"auth_mode":"oauth-proxy"` when you expected legacy mode

**Cause:** The server is running in OAuth mode (`REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth` or `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth-proxy`) instead of legacy mode. This can happen if:
- `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE` is set in your shell environment (e.g., via `export`), which takes precedence over `.env`
- The `.env` file doesn't explicitly set `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=legacy`, and a shell variable overrides the default
- The server was started with a previous configuration and hasn't been restarted after changes

**Solutions:**

1. **Check current auth mode**
   ```bash
   # Query the health endpoint
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   # Look for "auth_mode" in the response
   ```

2. **Check for shell environment overrides**
   ```bash
   # Shell env vars take precedence over .env file
   echo $REDMINE_AUTH_MODE

   # If set, unset it
   unset REDMINE_AUTH_MODE
   ```

3. **Explicitly set auth mode in `.env`**
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env file
   REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=legacy
   ```

4. **Restart the server**
   - Configuration changes require a server restart
   - The auth mode is determined at startup and cannot change at runtime
   ```bash
   # Find and stop the running server
   lsof -i :8000
   kill <PID>

   # Restart
   redmine-mcp-server
   ```

5. **Verify after restart**
   - Check server startup logs for: `Auth mode: legacy`
   - Query health endpoint to confirm: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`

### API Key Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- "401 Unauthorized" errors
- "Invalid API key" messages

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify API Key**
   ```bash
   # Check your .env file
   cat .env | grep REDMINE_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Generate New API Key**
   - Log into Redmine web interface
   - Go to "My Account" → "API access key"
   - Click "Show" to view or "Reset" to generate new key
   - Update `.env` with new key

3. **Check API Access is Enabled**
   - Ensure Redmine administrator has enabled REST API
   - Check in Redmine: Administration → Settings → API → "Enable REST web service"

4. **Confirm credentials with the health endpoint (legacy mode)**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```
   In legacy mode, `/health` probes Redmine with the configured credentials and reports the result under `checks.redmine`:
   - `"redmine": "ok"`: credentials accepted and Redmine reachable.
   - `"redmine": "unreachable"` with `"status": "degraded"`: credentials are present but Redmine rejected them or could not be reached (see `checks.redmine_detail`, e.g. `HTTP 401`).
   - `"redmine": "unconfigured"` with `"status": "ok"`: `REDMINE_URL` or credentials are not set yet (not a runtime failure).

   The response is always HTTP 200 so orchestrators keep treating it as a binary liveness probe; inspect the JSON `status` field for the real state.

### legacy-per-user: "Redmine did not accept this API key"

**Symptoms:**
- Tool calls fail with `code: PER_USER_AUTH` and "Redmine did not accept this API key (fingerprint ...abcd)"
- Or, within 5 minutes of a key reset: reads return fewer projects than expected or "no issues", and writes fail with 403

**Cause:** Redmine serves an unknown or reset key as the anonymous user on anything anonymous may read. The server checks each key once against `GET /users/current.json` and refuses it when Redmine answers 401. `/health` cannot catch this in `legacy-per-user` mode, because there is no shared key to probe with.

**Solutions:**

1. **Fix the key in the client.** Copy the current key from Redmine ("My account" → "API access key" → "Show") into the client's `X-Redmine-API-Key` header. The fingerprint in the error is the last four characters of the key the client sent.
2. **Wait out the cache after a reset.** An accepted key is cached for 5 minutes, so a key reset in that window can still get the anonymous view until the entry expires. A rejected key is cached for 60 seconds, so a corrected key is picked up on the next request.
3. **Remove the anonymous fallback.** Enable Administration → Settings → Authentication → "Authentication required" in Redmine. Redmine then answers any unrecognised key with 401 everywhere.

A 403, 5xx, timeout, or connection error during the check never produces this message: the request goes ahead and the real error, if any, comes from the tool call itself. See [legacy-per-user auth](legacy-per-user-auth.md#key-validation) for details.

### Username/Password Authentication Failed

**Symptoms:**
- "Authentication failed" errors when using username/password

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Credentials**
   ```bash
   # Check your .env file
   cat .env | grep REDMINE_USERNAME
   cat .env | grep REDMINE_PASSWORD
   ```

2. **Test Credentials**
   - Try logging into Redmine web interface with same credentials
   - Reset password if needed

3. **Use API Key Instead**
   - API key authentication is recommended over username/password
   - More secure and doesn't require password storage

### Permission Denied Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "403 Forbidden" errors
- "You are not authorized to access this resource"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check User Permissions**
   - Verify your Redmine user has necessary project roles
   - Contact project administrator to grant permissions

2. **Project Visibility**
   - Ensure projects are not private or restricted
   - Check project membership settings

## Installation Issues

### Import Errors

**Symptoms:**
- `ModuleNotFoundError` or `ImportError`
- "No module named 'redmine_mcp_server'"

**Solutions:**

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # For source installation
   uv pip install -e .

   # For PyPI installation
   pip install redmine-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Activate Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   # If using virtual environment
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Reinstall Package**
   ```bash
   pip uninstall redmine-mcp-server
   pip install redmine-mcp-server
   ```

### Dependency Conflicts

**Symptoms:**
- "Dependency conflict" errors
- Package version incompatibility errors

**Solutions:**

1. **Use Fresh Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create new virtual environment
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install redmine-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Update pip and setuptools**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
   ```

### Python Version Incompatibility

**Symptoms:**
- "Python version not supported" errors
- Syntax errors in code

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Python Version**
   ```bash
   python --version  # Should be 3.10 or higher
   ```

2. **Install Correct Python Version**
   - Python 3.10+ required for local installation
   - Use Docker deployment if Python upgrade not possible

---

## Runtime Issues

### Port Conflicts

**Symptoms:**
- "Address already in use" errors
- "Port 8000 is already allocated"

**Solutions:**

1. **Change Server Port**
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   SERVER_PORT=8001  # Use different port
   ```

2. **Find Process Using Port**
   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux
   lsof -i :8000

   # Kill process if needed
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

3. **Use Docker Port Mapping**
   ```bash
   # Map to different external port
   docker run -p 8001:8000 redmine-mcp-server
   ```

### File Permission Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "Permission denied" when accessing attachments
- Cannot write to attachments directory

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Directory Permissions**
   ```bash
   # Ensure attachments directory is writable
   chmod 755 ./attachments
   ```

2. **Configure Custom Directory**
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   ATTACHMENTS_DIR=/path/to/writable/directory
   ```

### Attachment Download Failures

**Symptoms:**
- "Failed to download attachment" errors
- File download URLs expire immediately

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Disk Space**
   ```bash
   df -h  # Ensure sufficient space in attachments directory
   ```

2. **Verify Redmine Permissions**
   - Ensure your Redmine user can access attachments
   - Check attachment exists in Redmine

3. **Configure Expiry Time**
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   ATTACHMENT_EXPIRES_MINUTES=120  # Increase expiry time
   ```

4. **Download Cap Exceeded**
   ```
   {"error": "Attachment N exceeds the 209715200-byte download limit."}
   ```
   Default 200 MB cap. Bump for known-large files:
   ```bash
   ATTACHMENT_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES=524288000  # 500 MB
   ```
   The cap is enforced mid-stream and the partial file is deleted on abort, so a too-large attachment doesn't leak storage.

### Attachment `content_url` Returns Unreachable Internal Hostname

**Symptoms:**
- `get_redmine_issue(include_attachments=True)` returns `content_url` like `http://redmine:3000/attachments/...`
- The URL is unreachable from your MCP client (host or open internet)
- Agent may waste a turn `web_fetch`-ing the unreachable URL

**Cause:** Redmine echoes back URLs built from its own configured hostname, which in Docker / reverse-proxy deployments is typically the internal service name. The bare API can't see your public hostname.

**Solution:** set `REDMINE_PUBLIC_URL` to the publicly-reachable URL of your Redmine instance. When set, attachment `content_url` values whose origin matches `REDMINE_URL` are rewritten to the public origin (preserving path / query / fragment / reverse-proxy subpath).

```bash
# In .env file
REDMINE_URL=http://redmine:3000              # internal, used by MCP server
REDMINE_PUBLIC_URL=https://redmine.example.com  # public, returned to clients
```

For subpath-mounted Redmine (`https://example.com/redmine/...`), pass the full URL including the prefix:

```bash
REDMINE_PUBLIC_URL=https://example.com/redmine
```

**Alternative:** if you can't configure a public URL, call `get_redmine_attachment(attachment_id=N)` instead. That tool downloads the bytes server-side and returns either an HTTP URL on the MCP server's own proxy (HTTP mode) or a local file path (stdio mode) — both reachable from your client regardless of Redmine's hostname configuration.

### Agile Fields Missing from Issue Results

**Symptoms:**
- `story_points`, `agile_sprint_id`, `agile_position` not present in `get_redmine_issue` response even though `REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED=true`

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify `REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED` is set correctly**
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED=true
   ```

2. **Grant Agile permissions to the user's role**
   - Go to **Administration → Roles and permissions**
   - Click the role assigned to your API user
   - Scroll to the **Agile** section and check the relevant permissions (e.g. `View board`)
   - Save — without this, the agile endpoint returns 403 even if the module is enabled

3. **Enable the Agile module for the project**
   - Go to Project Settings → Modules in Redmine
   - Check the **Agile** checkbox and save
   - Without this, the agile endpoint returns 403 and fields are silently omitted

4. **Verify the RedmineUP Agile plugin is installed**
   - Access your Redmine administration panel
   - Go to Administration → Plugins and confirm the Agile plugin is listed

5. **OAuth modes: re-authorize so the token carries the agile scope**
   - Under `oauth` / `oauth-proxy` the token must include the
     `view_agile_queries` scope, or the agile endpoint returns 403 even when
     the user's role grants Agile permissions.
   - The server advertises this scope automatically when `REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED=true`.
     If you enabled the flag after already authorizing, your existing token
     predates the scope: reconnect the MCP client so it runs a fresh OAuth flow
     and consents to the updated scope list.

### Tags Missing from Issue Results

**Symptoms:**
- `tags` is empty or absent in `get_redmine_issue` even though `REDMINE_TAGS_ENABLED=true` and the issue has tags in the web UI

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify `REDMINE_TAGS_ENABLED` is set correctly**
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   REDMINE_TAGS_ENABLED=true
   ```

2. **Grant `view_issue_tags` to the user's role**
   - Go to **Administration → Roles and permissions**
   - Click the role assigned to your API user
   - Under the **Issue tracking** section, check **View issue tags** and save
   - The additional_tags plugin omits the `tags` field from the API entirely
     when the caller lacks this permission, so the MCP returns `[]`.

3. **Enable issue tags in the plugin settings**
   - Go to **Administration → Plugins → Additional Tags → Configure**
   - Confirm issue tagging (`active_issue_tags`) is enabled

4. **Verify the additional_tags plugin is installed**
   - Go to **Administration → Plugins** and confirm *Additional Tags* is listed

5. **OAuth modes: re-authorize so the token carries the tags scopes**
   - Under `oauth` / `oauth-proxy` the token must include `view_issue_tags`
     (read) and, for writing, `create_issue_tags` / `edit_issue_tags`. The
     server advertises these automatically when `REDMINE_TAGS_ENABLED=true`
     (the write scopes are dropped in read-only mode). If you enabled the flag
     after authorizing, reconnect the MCP client so it runs a fresh OAuth flow
     and consents to the updated scope list.

**Note:** tags are only *returned* by `get_redmine_issue` (single-issue fetch).
The plugin injects them into `GET /issues/{id}.json` only, so `list_redmine_issues`
and `search_redmine_issues` do not include a `tags` field.

### Setting Tags Has No Effect (`tag_list` silently ignored)

**Symptoms:**
- Passing `tag_list` to `create_redmine_issue` / `update_redmine_issue` succeeds but the tags are not applied

**Solutions:**

1. **Confirm `REDMINE_TAGS_ENABLED=true`** — otherwise `tag_list` is silently dropped (like `story_points` without the agile flag).
2. **Grant the write permission** — the role needs **Create issue tags** (to introduce brand-new tag names) or **Edit issue tags** (which only permits tags that already exist project-wide). With only *Edit issue tags*, new names are silently discarded by the plugin.
3. **OAuth modes** — the token must carry `create_issue_tags` / `edit_issue_tags`; these are write scopes, so a read-only deployment (`REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY=true`) does not advertise them.
4. **Custom field named `tag_list`** — `tag_list` is intercepted before custom-field resolution, so a custom field with that exact name can't be set by name; use the explicit `custom_fields` id form for it.

**Note:** `tag_list` **replaces** the issue's entire tag set (it is not additive). Fetch the current tags with `get_redmine_issue` first if you want to add to them.

### Custom Field Named "story_points" Cannot Be Updated by Name

**Symptoms:**
- Passing `{"story_points": "value"}` in `update_redmine_issue` has no effect on the custom field
- The update succeeds but the custom field value does not change

**Cause:**
The key `story_points` is reserved — it is intercepted before custom field resolution regardless of whether `REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED` is set. When the plugin is disabled, the value is silently dropped; when enabled, it is routed to the Agile endpoint.

**Solution:**
Use the explicit `custom_fields` format with the field's numeric ID:
```python
update_redmine_issue(
    issue_id=123,
    fields={
        "custom_fields": [{"id": 42, "value": "8"}]
    }
)
```
Find the field ID via `list_project_issue_custom_fields(project_id)`.

### Agile Story Points Update Fails

**Symptoms:**
- `update_redmine_issue` with `story_points` returns an error
- Error message mentions "Story points is invalid"

**Solutions:**

1. **Use a non-negative integer or `null`**
   - Valid values: `0`, `1`, `5`, `8`, etc.
   - Pass `null` to clear story points
   - Negative values (e.g. `-1`) are rejected by Redmine with a 422 error

2. **Check the Agile module is enabled for the project** (see above)

### Memory or Performance Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Slow response times
- High memory usage
- Server crashes

**Solutions:**

1. **Enable Automatic Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   AUTO_CLEANUP_ENABLED=true
   CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES=10
   ```

2. **Monitor Resource Usage**
   ```bash
   # Check server resources
   docker stats  # For Docker deployment
   htop  # For local deployment
   ```

3. **Reduce Pagination Limits**
   - Use smaller `limit` values in `list_redmine_issues`
   - Default limit is 25 to prevent token overflow

---

## MCP Client Issues

### Server Not Appearing in MCP Client

**Symptoms:**
- Redmine server not listed in client
- Configuration not recognized

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Configuration Format**
   - Check configuration matches your client's format
   - See [MCP Client Configuration](../README.md#mcp-client-configuration)

2. **Restart MCP Client**
   - Reload VS Code or restart your MCP client
   - Configuration changes may require restart

3. **Check Server is Running**
   ```bash
   # Test health endpoint
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

### Tools Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- MCP client connected but no tools available
- "No tools found" messages

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Server Started Correctly**
   ```bash
   # Check server logs for errors
   redmine-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Test MCP Endpoint**
   ```bash
   # Should return MCP protocol response
   curl http://localhost:8000/mcp
   ```

3. **Reload Client Configuration**
   - Run MCP client's reload/refresh command
   - Reconnect to server

### Deployment Lag — Recently-shipped Tool or Fix Doesn't Appear

**Symptoms:**
- You merged a fix to `develop` (or pulled a release) but the running MCP server still returns the old behavior
- A newly-added tool isn't in the MCP client's tool list
- A docker container shows the right version in `--version` but exposes the old surface

**Cause:** new MCP tools are registered at server *startup* via `@mcp.tool()` decorators, which only run when the Python process loads the module. Behavior changes inside existing tools usually propagate without a restart (the function references in the module are the same), but **new tool registrations require restarting the server process**. In Docker, a bare `docker container restart` re-runs the same image — it doesn't pick up code changes; you need a rebuild.

**Diagnosis:** call `get_mcp_server_info` to read the deployed package version:

```python
get_mcp_server_info()
# -> {"server_version": "1.3.0", "read_only_mode": false, "auth_mode": "legacy",
#     "plugin_flags": {...}}
```

Compare `server_version` against the release / commit you expect. If they don't match, the deployment is stale.

**Solutions:**

1. **Docker (recommended path):** run `./deploy.sh` from the repo root. It rebuilds the image with current source, removes the old container, and starts a fresh one with the correct port mapping (`-p 8000:8000`) and env-file.

   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Docker without the script:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d --build   # --build is the important flag
   ```

   Without `--build`, Docker reuses the cached image, which still has the old code baked in.

3. **Local Python process:** stop the running `redmine-mcp-server` / `uv run python -m redmine_mcp_server.main` and start it again. Editable installs (`uv pip install -e .`) reflect source changes on the next process start.

4. **After restart, reconnect from the client.** In Claude Code, the `/mcp` command refreshes the tool list. Without that step, the client may still show the stale schema even after the server picked up the new code.

### HTTP Transport Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "HTTP transport not supported" errors
- "HTTP transport failed" messages

**Solutions:**

1. **Use HTTP-to-stdio Bridge** (for clients with limited HTTP support)
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "redmine": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-client-http", "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Verify Client Supports HTTP**
   - Check your MCP client's documentation
   - Some clients require specific transport types

## Debug & Logging

### Enable Debug Mode

**For Source Installation:**

Edit `src/redmine_mcp_server/main.py`:
```python
# Set debug mode
mcp.settings.debug = True
```

**For Docker Deployment:**

Add to `.env.docker`:
```bash
DEBUG=true
```

### View Server Logs

**Local Deployment:**
```bash
# Logs appear in terminal where server is running
redmine-mcp-server
```

**Docker Deployment:**
```bash
# View container logs
docker logs <container-id>

# Follow logs in real-time
docker logs -f <container-id>
```

### Common Error Messages

#### "redmine client not initialized"

**Cause:** Environment variables not loaded or invalid credentials

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file exists and has correct values
2. Verify credentials are valid
3. Ensure `REDMINE_URL` is set

#### "File not found or expired"

**Cause:** Attachment file was cleaned up or URL expired

**Solution:**
1. Re-download the attachment using `get_redmine_attachment`
2. Increase `ATTACHMENT_EXPIRES_MINUTES` in `.env`

#### "Token limit exceeded"

**Cause:** Too many results returned causing MCP token overflow

**Solution:**
1. Use smaller `limit` values in `list_redmine_issues`
2. Use pagination with `offset` parameter
3. Filter results with specific parameters
4. Use `journal_limit` on `get_redmine_issue` to paginate large journal lists

#### "This server is in read-only mode"

**Cause:** The `REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY` environment variable is set to `true`, blocking all write operations

**Solution:**
1. If you need write access, set the variable to `false` or remove it:
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY=false
   ```
2. If read-only is intentional (e.g., shared/demo instance), use only read tools:
   - `get_redmine_issue`, `list_redmine_issues`, `list_redmine_projects`, `search_redmine_issues`, `search_entire_redmine`, `manage_redmine_wiki_page(action="list"|"get")`, etc.
3. Blocked tools in read-only mode: `create_redmine_issue`, `update_redmine_issue`, plus the write actions of every `manage_X` tool (e.g., `manage_redmine_wiki_page(action="create"|"update"|"delete"|"rename")`, `manage_issue_category(action="create"|"update"|"delete")`, `manage_project_member`, `manage_issue_watcher`, `manage_issue_note`, `manage_time_entry`, `manage_product(action="create"|"update")`, `manage_contact(action="create"|"update"|"delete"|"assign_to_project"|"remove_from_project")`, `manage_deal(action="create"|"update"|"delete")`). See [Read-Only Mode](./tool-reference.md#read-only-mode) in the tool reference for the full breakdown.

#### "list_my_redmine_issues not found" / Import errors after upgrade

**Cause:** `list_my_redmine_issues` was removed in v1.0.0

**Solution:**
- Replace all usage with `list_redmine_issues(assigned_to_id='me')`
- The replacement supports the same filters and pagination options

## OAuth Mode (v2.1+: FastMCP Native Auth Migration)

### Symptom: every MCP request returns 401 (even with a valid bearer)

Native OAuth authentication validates Bearer tokens via Doorkeeper's `/oauth/introspect` endpoint (RFC 7662). If every request returns 401, the cause is usually one of:

1. **Introspection env vars not set.** The server fails fast at startup if `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID` or `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_SECRET` is missing in OAuth mode — re-check startup logs.
2. **Introspection client not authorized.** Per RFC 7662 §2.1, a client may introspect tokens only when it is either the token's issuer, holds the `introspection` scope, or matches an `allow_token_introspection` block. Stock Redmine ships with `allow_token_introspection false`. See `docs/oauth-setup.md` Step 2b for the in-place edit of `30-redmine.rb` that grants introspection rights to confidential clients.
3. **Doorkeeper introspection disabled in Redmine's default config.** Redmine ships `allow_token_introspection false`, which makes the `/oauth/introspect` route return 404. Verify with the curl test in `docs/oauth-setup.md` Step 2c.
4. **A standalone `Doorkeeper.configure` initializer silently wiped Redmine's config.** Symptom: Administration → Applications also returns 403 with the log line *"Access to admin panel is forbidden due to Doorkeeper.configure.admin_authenticator being unconfigured"*. Fix: remove any standalone `Doorkeeper.configure` block from `config/initializers/`; apply the introspection change in-place in `30-redmine.rb` instead. See `docs/oauth-setup.md` Step 2b for the why (Doorkeeper's `configure` rebuilds the entire config wholesale).
5. **Token expired.** Check the bearer's `exp` against current time; mint a fresh one if needed.

**Quick diagnostic:** hit `/health` on the MCP server. If `"status": "degraded"` with `"introspection": "unreachable"`, the problem is server-side (introspection endpoint or credentials). If `"status": "ok"`, the introspection client itself works, so the problem is per-token (expired, wrong app, etc.).

### Symptom: `/health` reports `"introspection": "unreachable"`

Likely causes, in order:

- `REDMINE_URL` unreachable from the MCP server's network.
- `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_*` credentials wrong (Doorkeeper returns HTTP 401 on the introspection POST).
- Doorkeeper introspection endpoint disabled.
- TLS verification failing (check `REDMINE_SSL_VERIFY` / `REDMINE_SSL_CERT`).

The probe result is cached for `HEALTH_INTROSPECTION_TTL_SECONDS` (default 30 seconds). Wait that long after fixing the underlying issue before re-checking `/health`.

### Symptom: clients see 401 where they used to see 503

This is by design after the FastMCP v3 auth migration. The previous middleware returned `503 upstream_unavailable` when Redmine was unreachable for token validation; FastMCP's `IntrospectionTokenVerifier` treats transport failures as auth failures and returns 401. Operators monitoring for 503 spikes should switch to:

- Watching `/health` for `"status": "degraded"`, OR
- Monitoring 401-rate spikes correlated with Redmine availability metrics.

### Emergency rollback from OAuth mode

If an OAuth-mode regression is impacting users and a fix is not immediate, fall back to legacy mode without redeploying a previous version:

1. Set `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=legacy` in the environment.
2. Provide `REDMINE_API_KEY` (or `REDMINE_USERNAME` + `REDMINE_PASSWORD`).
3. Restart the MCP server.

Legacy mode is preserved across versions and behaves identically to pre-OAuth deployments. Clients lose per-user scoping but regain availability.

If a legacy API key isn't available, revert to the previous application version via standard release rollback procedures (`RELEASE_SOP.md`).

### Symptom: clients fetching `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (without `/mcp`) get 404

The v2.1+ release dropped several discovery path aliases. Only these paths remain:

- `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` (canonical RFC 9728 §3.1 suffix-scoped form, mounted by `RemoteAuthProvider`)
- `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/mcp` (path-scoped RFC 8414 form, mirrors Redmine's Doorkeeper AS metadata in direct OAuth mode)

In `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth-proxy`, the authorization-server metadata describes FastMCP's OAuthProxy endpoints instead.

Clients should follow `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="..."` headers from 401 responses (RFC 9728 §5.3) rather than guessing paths. If a client hardcodes the dropped variants, update the client; we don't plan to restore aliases.

## api-key-login

Setup, security model and session rules are in the [api-key-login guide](api-key-login-auth.md). The entries below cover what users and operators actually run into.

### The server refuses to start

**Symptoms:** startup fails with one of:
- `Missing required env var: REDMINE_URL` or `Missing required env var: REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL`
- `Missing required secret env var: REDMINE_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY or REDMINE_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE.`
- `REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL must be https in api-key-login mode`
- `REDMINE_API_KEY_LOGIN_SESSION_DAYS must be a positive number of days`

**Solutions:** set the missing variable; serve the base URL over `https` (set `REDMINE_API_KEY_LOGIN_ALLOW_HTTP=true` only for local development); give the session length a positive number of days.

### "This login page was opened in a different browser, or its cookie was blocked"

**Cause:** a login only works in the browser the client opened, which receives a cookie when the login starts. The page refuses a browser without that cookie: a link copied into another browser, a private window, or a browser that blocks cookies for this site.

**Solution:** allow cookies for the server's address and start the connection again from the client, so the same browser runs the whole login.

### "Keys of Redmine administrators are not accepted here"

**Cause:** keys of Redmine administrators are refused by default, because they bypass Redmine's permission checks.

**Solution:** start the connection again from the client and log in with a second, non-administrative Redmine account; the refused login cannot be retried. Only if that is not an option, set `REDMINE_API_KEY_LOGIN_ALLOW_ADMIN=true`. See [Administrator accounts](api-key-login-auth.md#administrator-accounts).

### "Redmine could not be reached" on the login page

**Cause:** the server could not get an answer from `GET /users/current.json`: Redmine is down, `REDMINE_URL` is wrong, or a proxy redirected the request. The login attempt is not charged and the link stays valid for its 5 minutes.

**Solution:** check that the server can reach `REDMINE_URL` (the `/health` endpoint probes it), then go back to the login page and press Connect again within its 5 minutes, or start again from the client.

### "This login link is unknown or has expired"

**Cause:** login links are valid for 5 minutes and allow 3 attempts; the link is also gone once a login succeeded.

**Solution:** start the connection again from the client.

### Client registration fails with "redirect_uri ... is not allowed by this server"

**Cause:** the client's redirect URI is not on `REDMINE_MCP_ALLOWED_CLIENT_REDIRECT_URIS`. The default allows only loopback addresses, which local clients use.

**Solution:** add the hosted client's exact redirect URI pattern to the allowlist. Avoid `*`: it removes the protection against crafted `/authorize` links described in the [security model](api-key-login-auth.md#security-model).

### Everyone has to log in again after a deploy

**Cause:** the store below `FASTMCP_HOME/api-key-login/` is not on a persistent volume, or `REDMINE_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY` changed (a new key starts a new, empty store).

**Solution:** check the `api-key-login state directory: ...` line in the startup log and make sure that path is on a volume. The Docker image sets `FASTMCP_HOME=/app/data/fastmcp`, which `docker-compose` mounts. Keep the signing key stable.

### Tools return fewer results than expected, or "Redmine rejected the API key bound to this session"

**Cause:** the user's API key was reset, or the account was locked, in Redmine. Redmine serves an unknown key as the anonymous user on anything anonymous may read, so until the session ends, reads can return the anonymous view. The session ends at the first call that gets a 401 (the tool then returns "Redmine rejected the API key bound to this session") or at the next token refresh, within an hour.

**Solution:** nothing on the server. The client asks the user to log in again with the new key. To end sessions immediately after a reset, enable Administration → Settings → Authentication → "Authentication required" in Redmine.

### Every user was signed out at once

**Cause:** each token refresh checks the user's key with Redmine, and a 401 ends the session. A gateway or single-sign-on proxy in front of Redmine that answers 401 for its own reasons makes every check fail, so every session ends within an hour. A 403 or an unreachable Redmine does not end sessions.

**Solution:** make sure `REDMINE_URL` reaches Redmine's API directly, or that the proxy passes `X-Redmine-API-Key` requests through.

"""``list_redmine_issues`` and Redmine's short-filter forms.

Redmine carries a filter's operator *inside* the value -- ``Query#add_short_filter``
(``app/models/query.rb:745-755`` on 6.1.1) detects an operator prefix for the
filter's type and splits the remainder on ``|``, defaulting to ``=`` over the
split list. So ``"56|57"`` is two trackers, ``"!*"`` is "none", and
``"!5"`` is "not 5".

None of that can be written on the named parameters, and it should not be:
``assigned_to_id`` is deliberately ``Optional[Union[int, Literal["me"]]]`` so
the boundary refuses garbage rather than passing it to Redmine and returning an
empty list that a model reads as "nothing matched" (#116, pinned in
``test_user_id_typing_schema.py``). The route is ``filters``, which is merged
over the named parameters and so can express what they cannot.

That route worked and was undiscoverable: the docstring's own ``filters`` entry
said it was for "any filter not listed above", which tells a caller it does
*not* apply to these keys, while the tool's leading prose offers "find
unassigned issues" as a use case. These tests pin the route and pin the text
that makes it findable, since a shipped docstring is the only place most callers
can learn it.

See https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/250 (#250).

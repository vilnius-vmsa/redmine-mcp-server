"""``get_current_user(include_memberships=True)`` returns the caller's
project memberships in one request (#236).

Before this, nothing exposed "which projects do I hold, with which roles":
``get_current_user`` hand-built eight profile keys and ``list_project_members``
answers one project per call.

Two things these tests pin down:

- The include rides the original ``user.get("current")`` call. python-redmine
  lists ``memberships`` in ``User._includes``, so reading
  ``user.memberships`` without the include makes ``Resource.__getattr__``
  call ``refresh(itself=False, include=...)`` -- a second HTTP request for
  data the first response could have carried.
- The default response is unchanged, key for key.

These tests avoid ``Mock`` for the user object. A ``Mock`` answers every
attribute access, so a serializer reading keys Redmine never sent looks
correct under it, and a lazy ``.memberships`` read would silently succeed.
``FakeUser`` raises ``ResourceAttrError`` for absent attributes exactly as
python-redmine does, and records any lazy read instead of satisfying it.
